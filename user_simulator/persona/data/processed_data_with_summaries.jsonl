It is considered safe to eat.<br />The big hubbub back in the 1970's over it causing cancer was a manipulated testing. Lab rats were fed the equivalent of 600 diet sodas a day, something normal people come nowhere close to, no matter how much you love sodas. The &#34;study&#34; just &#34;happened to&#34; coincide with the big release of Nutrasweet, the newest lab sweetener on the block.  Every household in the country got a strip of five gumballs sweetened with this new miracle sweetener, while saccharine was vilified. Note that saccharine has subsequently been cleared as no more harmful than any other sweetener, but the P/R damage was already done.  Of more concern are later studies which seem to suggest that saccharine, while cleared as a carcinogen, seems to metabolize in your body similar to sugar. In other words, if you deal with high blood sugar, Sweet-n-Low will be viewed by your body about the same way regular table sugar would. It might make blood sugar stabilization harder. If you are only seeking reduced calorie amounts, then this is still a decent option.<br /><br />Equal:<br />The old blue packets are a mix of aspartame, dextrose, maltodextrin and acesulfame potasium.<br />Enough said. Note that Equal didn't want to lose any of the revenue from those using artificial sweeteners of any kind, and are making other sweeteners under the Equal brand name, including saccharine-only, sucralose-only and their latest one, Equal Next, a blend of aspartame and saccharine.  Yikes.<br /><br />NutraSweet:<br />This is the cutsie name given to the creation of aspartame.  Folks, this is just my opinion, but aspartame is something I recommend people avoid like the plague!  The physical interaction list is long, and range from just feeling bad to headaches, rashes, etc. In just our family, it gives my husband migraine headaches, and makes my tongue and lips swell up in an allergic reaction.  Everyone can do better.<br /><br />Of course now there are other less volatile options available, such as well-received stevia (although too much tastes bitter instead of sweet), and several types of sugar alcohols, such as mannitol, erythritol and xylitol, the latter of which also seems to offer some dental benefits. Sugar alcohols (also often called polyols) need to be consumed in moderation, because they can have a laxative effect when used too much. They do work well in recipes though, and there are a lot of cookbooks for low-carbers that use the polyols as the sweetener.<br /><br />Over all, this book might offer a variety of recipes that beats just water and a scoop of powder in your blender, but her misinformation about artificial sweeteners has me questioning what else she's stated as facts that are incorrect.

Mine is almost new, but<br />you can't drop the feed dogs, and covering doesn't help much on this model. It is more for sewing than quilting.)<br /><br />While everyone's artistic interpretation is always going to differ (that's what makes it art!),<br />the author explains how to achieve certain effects, how to create special additions to your art quilt, and<br />touches on how to \"paint\" with thread (she has another book devoted solely to thread painting as well).<br />She explains how to use fabric values, rather than color or pattern alone to achieve a visual impact.<br />She also explains about how to do portraits to have the best impact.<br /><br />Shortcomings - there were a couple. I think she could have delved a little deeper into HOW to get the value<br />determinations from your photographs or pictures. She mentions she uses Photoshop and Photoshop Elements to get them<br />herself, but doesn't touch much at all about how to actually do it. Note that this does not bother me - I already know<br />how, and have read about it in other quilting books. Perhaps she feels it was already sufficiently covered, and might<br />be redundant. However, it would have been helpful to cover a little bit more to help someone for whom this might<br />be their only quilting book purchase.<br /><br />I also feel she felt short in her explanations of her own quilting examples when it came to portraiture. She<br />has some really nice photos of her own work which she uses as an example, but she leaves the reader to decided for<br />themselves if she did a strictly value-based fabric collage or printed a photo onto computer fabric and just enhanced<br />with thread. There are references here and there, but there are also some unidentified examples. On page 75,<br />for example, in the quilt at the bottom of the page, I would like to know if the people there were printed directly<br />from a photograph to computer fabric and thread-enhanced, or if she pieced them from fabric and then thread enhanced.<br /><br />Overall - I highly recommend this book!<br />It is enjoyable to read, actually informational, doesn't assume too much, and will help me improve my art quilt skills.<br />Unless you are already an award-winning art quilter, I think everyone would find this one a very useful addition<br />to their personal quilt book library.<br />Great job by the author!", "ParentASIN": "0896898040", "Timestamp": 1373649700000, "ItemName": "Photo-Inspired Art Quilts: From Composition to Finished Piece (Create With Nancy)", "AuthorName": "Leni Levenson Wiener", "AverageRating": 4.7, "RatingCount": 73, "Price": 32.5, "Categories": ["Books", "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "Crafts & Hobbies"], "Description": "This book guides you through creating art quilts, teaching how to select and transform photos into fabric collages, and enhance them with techniques like thread painting and raw-edge machine appliqué.

It is only 43 pages long,<br />and 7 of those are for a copy of a kitten pattern of hers, so minus that and the one-page<br />introduction, there are only 35 pages of actual instruction.

In the end, there's just not much book for the price tag!<br /><br />While it does indeed explain how to break a photo down to get<br />realistic portrait effects for quilting, the book assumes that you are already a quilter.<br />It is mainly explaining how to use various computer programs to get a value (color value) breakdown<br />of your photo for easier layering for portrait effects. The author is very detailed and goes step-by-step<br />on three different computer graphics programs as to how to achieve layers in a graphic<br />and how to tweak photos.<br /><br />That is all well and good, but as someone who already knew how to use Photoshop Elements and how<br />to tweak photos, I was looking for more quilting information.<br />I might be alone out here, but I was NOT happy with the book.<br />The price alone was quite high, at least for me. I don't have a lot of extra money, and what I<br />do get, I like to spend on fabrics. I \"invested\" in this book to learn more about how to properly<br />quilt a portrait quilt, but instead got lessons on how to use Photoshop Elements or GIMP. I didn't<br />need that.<br /><br />At this point, I am contemplating sending it back, but not sure. In the future, I am sure I can glean<br />something I don't already know from the book, but I haven't even opened it since the first read-through<br />the day it arrived.

Because you will never know what you missed on the test.<br />That's right. ICTS only gives you your numeric score and a pass/fail graph results.<br />Each test section you took has a results page. They all lead to the exact same page, which is only the graph and number (like Reading - 199).  You will never be allowed to see your test answers, never allowed to know what areas in which you are weak.<br />This is a huge flaw. ICTS claims they can't give back test results because people would cheat. Sounds to me like the only ones cheating are the folks at ICTS. They cheat the students out of any real help this way.<br /><br />Let's say you scored 180 on the math out of a possible 300 (and the needed 240). Okay, you missed the goal by at least 60 points.<br />So, where is your weakness?  Instead of results that even go so far as to say you got 80% of the algebra questions right, 40% of the geometry questions right and 75% of the basic math right, you get a blanket number with no breakdown. You won't know if you are weak in geometry or some other area. You might have had a perfect score on all the geometry, but messed up the algebra questions, and need to review algebra. You'll never know.<br /><br />As it is, this is a nice financial racket for ICTS, but only milks the students. The Basic Skills 300 is very expensive to take.<br />The majority of students now fail this test after the Sep 2010 changes. I don't think a whole set of students suddenly got dumber, but that is what this test would lead someone to think. It keeps a lot of very good students out of their desired major, because without a score of at least 240 on each of the sections of this test, you cannot get into the education programs. Wanted to be a teacher since you were in elementary yourself? Can't think of anything else you've ever wanted to do? well, time to rethink your life, because Illinois has decided for you that if you can't pass their test with random hidden scoring, you can't possibly teach.<br /><br />What this test DOES do is show who can test well, or who is fresh out of high school.<br />Those people who love tests as a challenge or personal game to be won will love it. The white-knuckle testers, those<br />who break out into a sweat when they hear the word \"test\" will likely fail.<br />Those who are recent high school graduates will have all of this sort of data fresh on their minds, and probably do okay.<br />If you are older, it has been a while since you were in school and you want to go back for a teaching certificate<br />now that your kids are older, good luck with passing! You probably won't be able to get certified in Illinois. After all, there is a<br />shortage of teachers, IL certainly does not rank highly in national testing results, so instead of helping more students<br />get into good programs, they keep them at arm's length and lock them out. There are people with master's degrees who cannot<br />pass this test. Of course, they won't know why either, because of the ICTS policy of not sharing ANYTHING about your test results<br />with you except the grand total.<br /><br />Until ICTS can help students know WHAT they missed so they can study harder, it is a total shot in the dark, and both a waste<br />of money and time. The education programs in the state of Illinois are already very limited in scope and in the amount of space for students. They don't put education as a priority here, in my opinion. I didn't grow up here, thank goodness. But my spouse who did still is lacking in some very basic skills. Much like many states are doing, teachers teach to meet federal funding guidelines, rather than making sure all students have the skills they are trying to teach. They have a tight timeline and can't really spend the time with students like they should - the principal will be on their backs about meeting the school goals for federal funds.<br />So, ICTS helps to feed the un-education machine here by putting this test as a requirement, with nothing but practice tests to go on - there is NOTHING a student can do to help find out what they are missing on the tests. NOTHING. So, students continue to practice a broad variety of skills in hopes of passing it the next time they take it. Good luck - it's another random shot. You'll still not know what you missed or didn't miss - only the little black and white graph that will tell you if you tested good enough to apply to an education program.<br /><br />So, to sum up, if you don't pass the test the first time, you won't know why. You can, however, pay even more money out to ICTS for another chance to waste a morning several months later, long after you need to have passed. You can't get into the IL education programs to help you learn to be an effective teacher until you can prove you already know everything and don't need the program.<br />Yep - if you can do a great job on the test and already HAVE all the skills, then we'll let you into the education program, and you can spend the next two or three years taking classes that might or might not help you actually be a good teacher. But hey - it's only money and time. Those are both endless, right?  Right? (And I think we've all had teachers that were very smart themselves, probably  passed this test with a great score, but who can't manage to communicate the subject matter to the students, or who makes the students hate the subject after being in one of their classes! What a waste of human resources - this test rules out a lot of very good people who are not strong test takers.)<br /><br />This test proves NOTHING except showing who is good at taking tests.<br />It shows NOTHING about the potential to be a great teacher.<br />You can practice until you see test questions in your sleep, but you still will never know what you need to work on, because<br />ICTS keeps it all a secret.", "ParentASIN": "0738608041", "Timestamp": 1312697762000, "ItemName": "ICTS Basic Skills & Elementary/Middle Grades w/CD-ROM (ICTS Teacher Certification Test Prep)", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.3, "RatingCount": 7, "Price": null, "Categories": ["Books", "Computers & Technology", "Programming"], "Description": "REA offers a comprehensive test prep for the ICTS exams in Illinois, designed to help teacher candidates pass the Basic Skills (Field 096) and Elementary/Middle Grades (Field 110) tests.

It was. Of course it is rather flawed.<br /><br />The author makes his opinions known through out the book about UK bureaucracy. In the beginning he acknowledges the issues with determining a criteria. There are some surprising ommisions. I mean, I can understand why for example the kamikaze planes, He 162 or some others didn't go in but the Me 163 should have been included due to its habit of blowing up. The author meantions it, in his opinion it didn't meet the creteria. The nuclear bomber program isn't here. The XF-84H isn't here. Even though this is written after the cold war, there are barely any soviet aircraft included. The PZL M-15 is such an obvious choice, conceptually a failure in principle - not in the book.<br /><br />What planes there are here can be broken down in to three catagories: those that conceptually should have never been attempted, those that were trying to meet unrealistic (typically UK) requirements, and last those with problems that needed to bluggened away with money/time and/or better engines but were pushed in to service anyway due to war needs.<br /><br />It left me with a feeling that the auther was just going off memory, rather than research, considering how many UK planes were included from his own experience/familiarity.<br /><br />Last some of the put downs seemed unnecessary: \"accomplished nothing\" etc.<br /><br />Worthwhile for a single read, if you can get it from a library.", "ParentASIN": "0760303169", "Timestamp": 1675766711057, "ItemName": "Back to the Drawing Board: Aircraft That Flew But Never Took Off", "AuthorName": "Bill Gunston", "AverageRating": 4.3, "RatingCount": 10, "Price": 15.18, "Categories": ["Books", "Science & Math", "Technology"], "Description": "New, unused, and in excellent condition.

That's it.<br /><br />To describe this book another way, I would have to use a metaphor: imagine walking in on a university lecture on a technical subject matter - to make any sense of it you would have had to have taken prerequisite courses. This book is the same. There is no introduction on the basics of how engines work, or basic engine history or development history. There is much written in the book, with many pictures, but it is limited to production variants with some sporadic commentary. For example, while the importance of the sodium filled valve is mentioned multiple times, it was never actually explained why it was important - for that you need to have read about it beforehand. There is a lot of data in there. If you wanted to know what variant of Merlin was included in a specific sub model of a specific plane, this book (probably) has it. On the other hand, if you want to know anything about the Merlin such as 1) what it was 2) development history 3) what made it special 4) what impact it had - none of this is in there. There may be more than a dozen pages about the Merlin in the book, but those are spent on listing the variants and brief introduction on its production history. You need to already know the Merlin to make sense of the data, and for any of the data in the book to be of any use to you. This isn't my first book on the subject, but I personally didn't know anything about the Merlin and found the omission about what it was baffling.<br /><br />As for my specific complaints within the confines of the focus of the book:<br /><br />While I don't object to the focus of the book, I find that the sporadic commentary random at best, either it needed to be expanded or cut by an editor.<br /><br />Some engines are missing the weight figures. This might a limitation of having too much contradictory data, but even a range of values of \"low confidence\" would have been useful for some.<br /><br />No diagrams! The author tries to repeatedly to briefly explain some unique engine features verbally. A quick (even hand drawn) diagram would have quickly cleared things up. I had to read multiple times, and I still couldn't figure out how a radial engine with pistons parallel with the crankshaft worked.<br /><br />This might be a 10th book on the shelf for you, but not the 1st.<br /><br />As for my praises for the book:<br /><br />It seems to me that the primary reason for the high weight and low horsepower of earlier engines was due to the low octane figures of the available fuels of that time. This wasn't stated in the book outright, but it becomes obvious if you look.

I should emphasize it takes a lot of time, and it makes a mess, to process pallets. The mistake I made is trying to process all of the pallets that I had gathered. This book does say that you should be careful in picking only the pallets with a stamp on it, and without stains. But, you should be even more picky! If you get good boards that are nice, straight, without a finish that is full of splinters, and weird stains the job will go much easier. On the other hand it can be hard to detect slight warping of boards that only shows itself when you try to put your project together and nothing lines up. I suspect that after I finished processing the pallets I had gathered, less than one third was usable and the rest was fire wood. So my advice is when looking for pallets reject anything and everything that’s even a little off, it will save a lot of headache.<br /><br />Given my experience I will probably just stick to 2x4 boards myself. The other problem with pallet grade wood is that it limits you in to the kind of furniture you can make out of what you have. It's not Lego. I started collecting pallets wanting to build a book shelf of my own design, but had to give up due to the grade of the wood. As to the other projects, I don't get some if not most of them. I see the wall mounted pallet wine rack idea everywhere, but wine is supposed to lie on its side if the bottle uses cork. The other ideas I have seen are furniture that is somewhat useful, but is more of an &#34;accent&#34; type of furniture rather than primary furniture that you rely on daily.<br /><br />On the other hand I do like the idea of reuse. In situation where you have limited access to wood and lots of time on your hands, this certainly makes sense. Plus, hobbies are not supposed to be practical use of time anyway. So if you take a “what can I do with this” type of approach it will be fine.

His general recommendation was to use the GA(W)-2 / LS(1)-0413 / NASA LS(1)-0413 airfoil for the wing because it's popular for general aviation use, and NACA 0012 for the horizontal stabilizer. You're supposed to take his word on this. He then says that at 100,000 Reynolds number (as a hint, indoor models are well below that the rest are about 70k to 200k) or less the NASA LS(1)-0413 airfoil doesn't work so well. Why? I had to find this out in another book. While reading [[ASIN:1619540177 Aerodynamics for Naval Aviators: NAVWEPS 00-80T-80 (FAA Handbooks series)]] I came across a section that explains what happens to an airfoil under high and low Reynolds number. Using NACA 4412 as an example, I could tell from the diagram in the book that at an Re of 9 million the airfoil will develop the highest lift coefficient at an angle of attack of 14 and stall past 15, while at Re of 100000 this will happen at of 8 and 12 AoA. As explained in that book this is because at low Reynolds numbers the flow will become laminar and will not have enough energy to stick to the wing at higher angles of attack. To me this make much more sense than saying that &#34;it will not work as well.&#34; I then compared the Clark-Y airfoil against Reyes recommended airfoil LS(1)-0413 that he favors over the Clark-Y, on airfoiltools dot com. To me at Re of 100000 the Clark-Y actually looks like a better choice. While it might look like that the LS(1)-0413 develops a slightly higher Cl(max) overall at 11 AoA, and stalls at 14, the Clark-Y will reach a lower Cl(max) at 12 AoA - but will stall out at 18 AoA. To me that seems like a better deal. A higher max AoA means more room for control error, gusts, etc. A proper book would have provided way for you to make that decision yourself. I then read [[ASIN:1854862707 Model Aircraft Aerodynamics]] and realized that there is also something called a critical Re number. So an airfoil that does not “work well” below an Re of 100000, what that actually means is that the airflow completely breaks down. The critical Re number is the number you want preferably below the stall, not the number the plane will actually fly at!<br /> While the book has many formulas, oddly enough he suggests a cryptic method for calculating vertical stabilizer size by cutting out pieces of cardboard based on side body profile and certain wing area size. I get that there is trial an error involved with reading [[ASIN:1854862707 Model Aircraft Aerodynamics]] in respect to dutch roll and spiral stability, but Reyes seems to suggest that it's easy.<br /> Reyes makes some points on materials, engines, batteries, etc. But In the end I have no idea how any of that goes together.<br /><br /> Third. In the end a wing airfoil is just one part of a wing, yet he doesn't talk about wings themselves. His only wing planform is the crescent shape! What about explaining how different wing planforms effect tip stalls, which is included in every aerodynamics book? Rectangular, delta, swept, etc. There is no mention of flaps besides him telling you that they serve no purpose on a slow flying model.<br /><br /> Fourth. Some of Reyes book reads like some of the first parts of [[ASIN:1600869114 Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach (Aiaa Education Series)]]. There are countless small factoids and side points included by Reyes that cover full size airplanes that frankly should have been edited out do to the objective of the book. For example both Authors mention Rutans' VariEze, Raymer mentions that that the winglets on the wings presented a novel dual use design in that they serve as both winglets and vertical stabilizer/rudders, while Reyes mentions that it was the first airplane with winglets. Raymers' point in the context of an airplane design book is interesting, Reyes point in a model design book on the other hand is useless. I expect model specific examples!<br /><br /> Fifth. There are many formulas and some tables with calculated values, but when I tried to use Table 6.1. Scale Factors on page 124 it became apparent that the figures provided for weight % are incorrect. Instead I looked through the Bibliography and started a search for the recommended books instead, and in starting to read some those (Simons, etc) I have to say they are miles apart.", "ParentASIN": "0982261322", "Timestamp": 1441918595000, "ItemName": "RCadvisor's Model Airplane Design Made Easy: The Simple Guide to Designing R/C Model Aircraft or Build Your Own Radio Control Flying Model Plane", "AuthorName": "Carlos Reyes", "AverageRating": 4.1, "RatingCount": 88, "Price": 25.0, "Categories": ["Books", "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "Crafts & Hobbies"], "Description": "This book, \"RCAdvisor's Model Airplane Design Made Easy,\" guides both beginners and experienced model airplane builders through the process of designing and building their own model airplanes.

If I had read the Muirwood series first I don't know if I would have continued. Don't get me wrong, I really like the first two books of this series (The first being The Wretched of Muirwood). But I think Jeff's storytelling has improved over time. The Kingfountain series and Muirwood are not related in any way other than style, but Kingfountain is better written in my opinion.<br /><br />I read Wretched of Muirwood and was lukewarm about continuing. But I needed a book to listen to while I am in the kitchen, and the deal with being able to listen to this book for free with Audible when you are a Kindle Unlimited subscriber is just terrific. So I gave it a try and was pleasantly pleased.<br /><br />PROS: The main characters are very likable. They are noble and just and all the things a hero should be. The main female character is strong and determined. The descriptions are lovely, and taken from various beautiful areas of the USA (Redwood forest in particular). I like the magic and the &#34;learner&#34; concept. The story is easy to listen to both in narration (the narrator in the Audible book is terrific) and in overall feeling and tone. It's a good bedtime read - nothing to awful to give you nightmares or set your heart racing.<br /><br />CONS: There is a religious subtext that you have to get over or be okay with. I am not religious, but do have an idea of spirituality. The idea of the &#34;medium&#34; is not unlike the Christian &#34;holy spirit&#34; or Chinese &#34;qi (chi)&#34; or Star Wars' The Force, for that matter, or other life force/spiritual energy ideas. I enjoy the idea of this, and it actually makes the book more fantasy than religious.

And 15 year old girls talking about marriage with 18-19 year old men is a little uncomfortable in modern times, although truly not unusual in medieval times.<br /><br />The ending for me was so predictable. So predictable that you are like &#34;how can these &#34;scholars&#34; not figure this out?&#34;.

I have enjoyed them all very much.  She basically uses the same formula for all of these books.  The heroine is above-average but not outstanding in beauty.  She may or may not be wealthy, but she is almost always outspoken to the point that others in late Regency London think her to have \"too much of an opinion on matters for her own good\".  She lives by a strong code of moral conduct, although she is not judgmental of others, and is rather open-minded for the period.  She has sisters or other relatives that make life less than pleasant for her. These relatives are predictable, and rude, and selfish.  She is not desperate for a husband, but not adverse to the idea in general.  She strives to be independent, and, in short, is appealing to 21st century women.  It's how we would like to think we would have been if we had lived in the 1830's in London.  The hero is also very similar throughout the books.  He is handsome, rich, independent, and has had some sort of hardship in his past.  He has very good moral character in general, although may have had a mistress or two along the way.  He doesn't think much of the heroine when he first meets her, as she is so different from typical young ladies of the time.  However, he comes to appreciate the strength of character the heroine shows when she is unfairly accused or accosted by some rogue (often Caroline Bingley's dastardly son).  And they live happily ever after.<br /><br />So why do I like these so much if they are all rather the same?  The answer is that the formula, with Mrs. Aston's pleasant writing style, works very well.  I like the characters and I want to find out what happens to them.  I like how the author often includes details of dress, fabrics, furniture, houses, landscapes, etc.  Not to the point of distraction, but enough to make it very enjoyable to read.  She sprinkles in some interesting characters, and brings them back in several of the novels.  With the exception of minor appearances by the ever mean-spirited Caroline Bingley and the buffoon clergyman Mr. Collins, Mrs. Aston does not attempt to use Jane Austen's characters in her novels, but rather created her own set of characters.  The effect is fresh, and fun.  This is a great kind of escape novel, when you would like something to ease your mind, and take you away to a romantic setting.  There is nothing disturbing or vile in them at all, something you could feel comfortable giving to your 80 year old grandmother to read.

I was right. McLain has reduced Markham's groundbreaking and controversial life to a series of marriages and affairs, giving a vapid voice to the very acerbic and forceful Markham. Famous members of the Happy Valley set make staged and contrived appearances, feeling more like desperate name-dropping than actual historical encounters.<br />This is a decently written book and the author has the good grace to clearly promote the book as a work of fiction. How sad to co-opt the life of an endlessly fascinating and unique woman to write a fleshed-out romance novel.  McLain apparently lacks the scholarship and intellect of a serious biographer--or perhaps she was aiming strictly for a money maker, or looking for an excuse to write off a safari. McLain has reduced the life of a remarkable, pioneering woman to endless, tedious pages of mooning over &#34;the love of her life&#34;, Denys Finch Hatton.  This bears scant resemblance to Markham's real life.  Nowhere in this vapid novel are Markham's real accomplishments brought to the fore--they are merely backdrop for her mooning.  The author has projected her own feelings of childhood abandonment onto Markham, with apparently very little actual factual evidence.  Markham's extreme sexual appetite is never addressed in its proper context, and some of her far more personally influential and controversial lovers are not even mentioned, as the reality would conflict with the author's insistence that Finch Hatton dominate Markham's every thought.<br />Beryl Markham would have scoffed at this book.<br />Thank God I bought the Kindle version and at least saved some trees from needless death.", "ParentASIN": "0345534182", "Timestamp": 1438437274000, "ItemName": "Circling the Sun: A Novel", "AuthorName": "Paula McLain", "AverageRating": 4.3, "RatingCount": 25811, "Price": 16.6, "Categories": ["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction"], "Description": "Circling the Sun is a New York Times bestseller and a captivating novel about Beryl Markham, a pioneering aviator and writer raised in 1920s Kenya.

She very correctly relates the loving and pampered lives of show dogs, and the devotion of their owners.<br />  Ms. Newcomb has now finished several champions and considers herself a dog show veteran who has \"mastered\" dog show terminology and practices.  Odd, then, that the book has some glaring and amateurish errors.  She mentions an exhibitor whose Bichon Frise won the Toy Group at Westminster.  Bichons are in the Non Sporting Group; only a dog show person would know that, but that is who Ms. Newcomb wishes us to see her as.<br />  She also states that after 2012 Westminster \"will never be the same\" because the Kennel Club has had to partially expand to another venue, and now allows class dogs to enter (not restricting the entry just to champions). Had Ms. Newcomb done any research, she would have learned that the same criticisms were leveled when Westminster moved from the original Madison Square Garden to the \"New\" Garden on 8th Avenue.  She would also have learned that Westminster allowed class dogs for many years, until the entry became too large for the facility.  Class dogs may once again be shown because the Piers breed judging location has the space to accommodate it.<br /><br />  Those are minor complaints compared to my biggest problem with the book.  Ms. Newcomb portrays herself as a typical dog show person, willing to accept her new life in a house filled with dog \"poop, lots of poop!\" and papers on the floor where her Chihuahuas routinely urinate.  She tells many amusing stories of cleaning up poop all over the house, and having to repeatedly clean carpets and throw out rugs.  Are you kidding me...???  I was raised with champion show dogs and have had my own champions my entire life, and I have never tolerated a house filled with dog s***!!  Nor does anyone I know!  Admittedly, toys are difficult to housebreak, but the toys I have owned were not allowed to dirty the house. That is disgusting!!!  Couldn't Ms. Newcomb have forgone purchasing at least one of her ten dogs so she could build a secure covered run for her dogs to urinate in?  It's not rocket science, and I resent the fact that people reading this book assume dog show breeders and exhibitors live with their dogs in filth.<br /><br />  Ms. Newcomb has also assumed the neophyte's bias against professional handlers, who do frequently win over amateurs (maybe because they're professionals?).  While she does speak nicely of several professionals, she refers to a handler that \"looks like a supermodel\", one that \"flirts shamelessly\", and relates numerous \"dirty tricks\" professional play.  (On her website promoting her book Ms. Newcomb refers to a handler at the Garden who has \"an entourage of helpers but he was paid a ton of money\" as though it is somehow unfair for a handler to run a business.) Ms Newcomb relates a litany of dog shows and specialties where the professional handlers win with top dogs, implying political influence on the handlers' part.  At one point she states that dog show success is ruled by money.<br /><br />  Professional handlers are just that--professionals.  They maintain expensive kennels and staffs, travel often to 310 shows a year, routinely work 14-16 hour days, assume incredible liability for their charges, have served lengthy apprenticeships and have an enormous base of knowledge.  It is a business, not politics.  Someone who shows one or two dogs for pocket money is NOT a professional handler.  The top handlers don't have time to \"flirt shamelessly\", as they are usually showing between 20-30 dogs per day.  And you think they shouldn't be paid for that?  Ms. Newcomb's daughter is a professional singer; should we then infer that her daughter flirted, manipulated, and slept her way to success, or should we think that  her daughter is a gifted singer whose hard work and talent enables her to make a profession of her ability?<br /><br />  Ms. Newcomb, despite being a real dog show person, is apparently unaware that there are many powerhouse owner-handlers and breeder/owner/handlers that routinely dominate the show rings at the highest levels.  Owner handlers have gone Best in Show at Westminster.  Pat Craig, one of the most visible breeder/owner/handlers, has won the Hound Group at Westminster TEN TIMES.  She is not a multi-millionaire, she is not a professional handler (though she could be)...she has extremely good dogs and she handles them well.  Should we resent anyone who is successful, or just those who make a living at it?<br />  Money may allow someone to hire a professional handler, but the wealthiest person in the world won't get far with an ugly dog.<br /><br />  I wish Ms. Newcomb well; I hope she continues to show dogs and continues to win. She has worked diligently with her dogs and their championships are deserved.  Read this book and smile at her accomplishments, but go to a dog show and see for yourself.

Written at an elementary school level (is the author aiming for a readership of immigrants with no language skills? Even the book cover is in the syle of a children's book.) the main focus of the book is the Muslim orientation of the Zeitoun family.  Only at the end is it stated that the protaganist's Muslim/Arab heritage was not a factor in his arrest.  Rather than exploring the complex issues of martial law and the suspension of Habeaus Corpus and Fourth Amendment rights surrounding Zeitoun's detention, the author produces a laundry list of abuses Zeitoun has suffered, several times mentioning the presence of \"troops who have just returned from Iraq and Afghhanistan.\"  It is only by reading on that we realize that the true offenders were guards and wardens from the local maximum security prison--not returning soldiers.  We are told of a Pentagon Red Cell Team who explored the possibility of terrorist activity during natural disasters, implying that some shadowy military presence pushed DHS staff to view Zeitoun as \"Al Qaeda\", when, in fact, the DHS personnel were the only professional and helpful people Zeitoun encountered, and the ones who cleared his name of any involvement in illegal activities. This would have been a perfect vehicle to examine the culture of victimhood prevelant in many Middle Eastern societies and immigrants, and explore the political motivations behind those views and what proportion of them are warranted.  Instead, Eggers praises the happy life and close families of Syria, stating that Zeitoun's wife, an American-born convert to Islam, considers moving her family to the Syrian paradise if her husband is found deceased.  Eggers glosses over \"certain government actions\" that made Syria a difficult place (most of Zeitoun's family left), and never explores exactly why his Syrian relatives are in such a blind panic over Zeitoun's imprisonment.  Could it be their only frame of reference is the Syrian mukhabarat and its prison system?  What Zeitoun went through in New Orleans is risible compared to torture at the hands of the Syrians.  Just ask the Lebanese.  And Mr. Eggers, when you were busy enjoying your stay in Syria, did you visit Hama?  Perhaps you would have gotten a different perspective.  In the end, despite his unwarranted detention, the Zeitoun family is living the American dream. They come out of Katrina with their business intact and enough credit and cash to buy up half of their block and enlarge their house.  Zeitoun becomes even more of a workaholic, spending even more time away from his family and pursuing his own course--the same rather selfish actions that led him to stay in New Orleans despite a mandatory evacuation order and against his family's wishes, and that ultimately led to his detention.

Put it in a place that will get natural light and keep the dish filled with water.

Soak a handful of dried kidney beans in water overnight.<br /><br />Then take a see-through plastic glass or jar and put a damp paper towel in it. Tuck some of the pre-soaked kidney beans (evenly around the container) between the paper towel and the container so that you can see it. Put it on a windowsill where it will get plenty of natural light, sprinkle the paper towels with water each day so they stay damp, and the beans will soon sprout.<br /><br />The children will be able to see the roots and shoots! Once the bean growth is about 2\" or so -- transplant them into soil -- they'll continue growing.<br /><br />It is a great way to have fun with your children while teaching science and reading.

As it came up in a grouping of Barbara Michaels, and other noteworthy authors, I expected it to be on par with these writers. I was highly disappointed, to say the least.<br />As the title blurb explains, the book is based on an overused gothic fantasy; the heroine - a poor, struggling college student/working teacher - inherits over 500 million dollars and a ramshackle mansion from an unknown biological grandfather. She must fulfill two conditions: change her name and live in the mansion.  In the first three chapters alone, her personality seesaws from a petulant reluctance to change her name ( a requirement to inherit) to that of a spoiled brat- witness the outburst where she insists everyone call her by her &#34;new&#34; name and &#34;respect her house&#34; and the house of her hitherto unknown family. While I realize the outburst is a technique to introduce some type of haunting or possession, the entire thing is so badly done it boggles the mind.<br />Her generosity in paying off her friends and fiancé's student loans, and inviting them to freeload on her home and fortune are counterpointed by her insistence that they change their lifestyles.  I understand that this is a rather new author, certainly I didn't expect anything along the lines of Clive Cussler or Dean Koontz, but this 12 year old drivel is impossible to take. I can't even read past the third chapter. I have read and graded papers from 6th graders that had more consistency of plot and depth of character. So far, the only depth in any character is the obvious schizophrenia of the heroine!<br />It is not my normal manner to deride or put down any effort to create literature. I read and enjoy everything from Plato to Tom Clancy to Louis L'Amour. I have read and edited numerous papers for grads and undergrads, and believe me, they often require much editing. I cannot believe any publishing house would print this, nor that Amazon would put it out in media. I suppose I am to blame for my own disappointment.  What does one expect for 99 cents? In truth, though, price determines my purchase less than a new author, even one with a tired, old, trite plot line.

Virtual and remote work isn’t new; what’s different since the pandemic is virtual at scale. The broad expansion of work-from-home amplified experiences we know also occur in face-to-face meetings and created a few new issues for leaders and participants to consider.<br /><br />One benefit for Dr. Johnson’s readers is her intentionally short format—in her words, “skinny, get-to-the-point.” Busy professionals don’t have time to hunt for important takeaways. The author keeps her chapters concise.<br /><br />Once she shares what goes wrong for many participants, Dr. Johnson presents a clever play on the typical “pie chart.” She recommends positive actions as ingredients to a recipe, where leaders need to utilize each to prevent the recipe from failing. These are introduced in Chapter 8 and detailed in Chapter 9. As a quick summary, individuals who plan and conduct virtual meetings need to:<br /><br />• Eliminate back-to-backs,<br />• Have lots of breaks,<br />• Take turns,<br />• Be real,<br />• Prepare,<br />• Use cameras wisely,<br />• Have fewer,<br />• State the goal,<br />• Stick to the agenda,<br />• Encourage small talk, and<br />• Keep it short.<br /><br />Most leaders will recognize elements that support effective meetings in any context. There’s more to the descriptors than a reader might first imagine. Making Virtual Work ties these to a work environment inundated with online work events and differences arising when working-from-home versus the office. Because these are both timely and timeless, as well as presented in an easy to digest and execute format, I’ve rated the book with four stars.<br /><br />At the same time, readers should know the material is presented as a “you” narrative. You need to show empathy. You need to sit in their seats. You need to resonate with their experience. You need to take responsibility and change how virtual works. The provocative declarations seem intended to help readers see themselves in the failure mode and push towards a necessary shift. Most readers who don’t find the device motivating can get past this.

While structural barriers exist in our organizations, the book also describes scenarios where women have slowly conceded their personal power over time. Marcus divides the book into three sections:<br /><br />In Part One: Assumptions, Fears, and All the Crap about Aging That Holds You Back, the author deals with specific limiting beliefs and barriers. Because Marcus describes a broad range of potential concerns, not all of these will resonate with a given woman’s experience. The key to part one is to begin recognizing how we are responding to signals in society and at work that suggest getting older is somehow becoming less.<br /><br />Part Two: Stop Playing Small, and Do What It Takes to Stay in the Game offers readers specific strategies to adopt in the workplace. While the book is targeted to the over 50 woman, many actions would also benefit women earlier in their career. As a point of fact, many women may have successfully employed a few of these tactics at a prior career phase. Marcus reminds women to refresh and retool their proactive stance.<br /><br />In the final section of the book, Part Three: Be Your Badass Self, readers find opportunities for selfcare and personal growth that extend beyond the workplace. We are not solely career women; we are women who have careers. Embracing our multiple identities and needs as a woman is an important part of positioning ourselves for success in life and work.<br /><br />While I’ve focused this narrative on the benefits for women, men would find several suggestions equally valuable.

Through intentional design, the book offers an array of images to draw us into the spaces of our world’s penguins, balanced by the compelling story Bergman shares.<br /><br />Bergman weaves what he learns and experiences within descriptions of the various penguins, their antics, their struggles, their environments. Through his eyes and interactions, we SEE the beauty and dignity, along with their curiosity and play. We are brought near to profound ritual in courtship, and determination in hardship.<br /><br />Just as important as recognizing what delights us about penguins, is seeing the influence of human activity and challenges to the environments where these animals come from. Penguin populations—like honeybee colonies (although this connection didn’t come from the author)—are collapsing. Only direct intervention of those who study the species and choices we ourselves might make will determine the outcome of survival of penguin species.<br /><br />The narrative includes how Bergman embarked on his quest and his inspiration as a single specimen approached him and made an in-your-face inquiry, “who are you?” To share more on how this plays out might spoil your experience of the story.

Win Every Day", "Content": "Win Every Day: Proven Practices for Extraordinary Results, Mark Miller’s latest contribution to his High Performance Series, is another win (pun intended) for business leaders who want to make an impact. If your organization's execution is faltering, Win Every Day lays out the game plan for change. For readers unfamiliar with the series, Miller teaches through allegory—or as the author terms it, “business fable.”<br /><br />Instead of taking an expert point of view and sharing a “how-to,” Miller narrates a story from which we learn the concepts, mindsets, and processes to enable exceptional execution as these unfold in the characters’ experiences. Fans of Chess Not Checkers will recognize Blake Brown, a CEO with a company in need of an execution reboot.<br /><br />Blake, a “composite” of leaders Miller has worked with, learns critical components of execution from both a new football coach brought into his son’s school and the real-time experiences of his son who was inspired to join the program. Blake, in turn, shares the concepts with key company personnel to translate these for an organizational application. This cascades through communication, explanations, understanding, and buy-in for the roles and activities required to manage moving the business toward goals.<br /><br />As with any program, senior leadership must be on board and champion change. A key assigned lead has to ensure messages are on point, and the concepts are learned, embraced, and acted upon. Readers will resonate with different recognizable characters who might be in siloed obliviousness to the impacts of their own function, raise issues, challenge ideas, or seek to avoid blame.<br /><br />I appreciate Miller’s approach to teaching through storytelling. Research tells us our brains are better at encoding story into memory than a checklist. We also relate story to our own lives and experiences in nuanced ways.<br />Here’s an example of the difference. Win Every Day could have given business reasons why everyone must buy-in and participate in a key program to achieve success. In the book, the new coach, with a stellar history of generating consistent wins, is brought in to a school with a ho-hum football program. He calls for a school assembly and plays a video that begins with compelling imagery and music, but then ends abruptly.<br /><br />When asked, few students clap to acknowledge liking the film. The coach then tells them what’s wrong. He states there are few students involved or engaged. He shares that the images didn’t portray reality. He introduces the first lesson of the book: “The best way to win on game day is to learn how to Win Every Day.” Finally, he tells students the video isn’t finished. They will write the story’s end with their actions.<br /><br />He asks for students to try out who may not have played before. He asks for students to become involved, working with coaches, trainers, and other roles. He asks for students to become participants in the stands. He tells them they can ALL write a “next chapter” for themselves. He encourages them to “Join us and help us create something legendary!”<br /><br />The messages are something different, something exciting. As the coach leaves, there is thunderous applause. We could simply have read, “get everyone on board.” Or, we can feel the excitement of the crowd when everyone is inspired to do so. Throughout the book, the lessons are explained and implemented as part of the storyline.<br /><br />Miller composes a fast read, which encourages the reader to think and reflect as each concept is presented. An abundance of data informs us about the value of reflection. In particular, we grow and develop when we contemplate our experiences and reflect on what we’ve learned and been exposed to. Readers might put themselves in any character’s shoes and ponder, “How would this play out in my own company?”<br /><br />Win Every Day is the fifth book of the series; each can be read as a stand-alone. The first, Chess Not Checkers: Elevate Your Leadership Game, introduces leadership as an overarching strategy. The other books in the series are:<br />• Leaders Made Here: Building a Leadership Culture,<br />• Talent Magnet: How to Attract and Keep the Best People, and<br />• Win the Heart: How to Create a Culture of Full Engagement.<br /><br />And, for readers who prefer to have concepts pulled out separately, Miller offers field guides and other material to augment the learning and help craft an implementation plan in companies. A section in the back of each book describes how to access these.<br /><br />If you’re a leader with an execution problem, grab a copy of Win Every Day.<br /><br />As an executive coach and leadership development professional, I was provided an advance copy of Win Every Day for my honest review. I only recommend books that I believe will offer a benefit. You don't have to be a CEO or hold positional authority to serve and strengthen your leadership right where you are today.

You should be!", "Content": "Haley Evans, a working mom in Tennessee, had an epiphany. The incessant pings on her smartphone didn’t just intrude on her life. These impacted her attention span, shifted her from mindful response to reactive modes, and generated stress. The ongoing interruptions actually made it more likely she might drop one of the many balls she was juggling in life. The attempt to multitask made her less efficient and effective, not more.<br /><br />My favorite visual from Haley’s book was her use of the metaphor of chickens pecking relentlessly.  A text from a youngster who—by the way—is in another room in the same house: Peck. A message from a colleague: Peck. A group text about an event, where others reply to all: Peck. Peck. Peck.<br /><br />While, for me, interruptions don’t source from my cell phone, I totally related to this “chickens pecking” analogy and I’ve seen colleagues, family members, and strangers at the grocery store all being pecked at via their devices. We can ask, “so what?”<br /><br />Haley has done her homework to share that answer with readers. Her research spans psychology and neuroscience, explores smartphone addiction, considers studies that make connections regarding teens and depression, bullying and suicide, how our brain’s light up as if we’re on cocaine, and so much more. She also explores the impact of how we choose (or not) to put our lives in social spaces, and what this can mean for our children. Haley also describes the difference between capturing a moment and immersing our self in the experience. There’s a real case for paying attention and considering a change.<br /><br />Hung Up is short. Haley narrates her experiences and what she’s learned in 99 engaging pages. Another 27 pages provide a quiz to check your own (and your family’s) relationship to devices, offers a step-by-step challenge (The Big Hang-Up 7 Day Challenge) to shift device use to a more mindful relationship, and the references she cites in her book.<br /><br />Disclosure: because I serve leaders as an executive coach, I'm occasionally sent review copies of books.

Fowler gives individuals a way to examine their choice, connection, and competency, as well as assess motivational drivers for change.<br /><br />Sections of the book readers might find extremely helpful include question prompts to determine the type of motivation used; opportunities to create (or improve the quality of) choice, connection, and competence; and cases/stories linking the experiences of others to the content. Fowler also encourages readers who find themselves applying suboptimal motivation to make shifts towards more optimal sources of inspiration and stimulus to act.<br /><br />Additionally, Fowler emphasizes reflection as a component of creating change. Research tells us reflection offers a powerful source of insight and potential activation. In my own research and practice, I find leaders who are willing to engage in reflection, learn, and apply the resulting knowledge are far more likely to make change that “sticks.”<br /><br />Once in awhile, a book takes some warming up to. I confess to having to push through the intro, not because the author failed to write in a compelling way, but because I used language differently. Words we choose often require context, so once I moved to the chapters, the book’s message became more resonate.<br /><br />I also hit an inadvertent barrier when Fowler invited readers to think of something we find distasteful and then consider how we might move to appreciation. The problem in the exercise was, when I paused at the word distasteful to come up with an example before moving on, what popped into my head was “liver.” I can’t begin to fully convey the utter revulsion of liver for me; so when Fowler’s next sentences suggested intentionally experiencing my “thing” and looking for positives, there was no place for me to go.<br /><br />Her actual example used “classical or rap music,” where a person could listen and consider alternative thinking. In the moment, I happened to be on a long road trip and read this section to my travelling companion. We discussed how our collective interest in culinary arts possibly primed me to be more literal with the word distasteful than another reader.

Suddenly, the chatter, background music, people on cell phones, rustling of food wrappers, etc. ceases.

Organized in four sections, Dr. Nathaniel Dunigan shares the poignant narrative of three African men: Thursday, Luke and Bennett. In this review, I’ll share key components of the book, it’s potential for group use and opportunities for further engagement.<br /><br />The stories of Thursday, Luke and Bennett illuminate the lived experiences of African males at three life stages. Each narrative reflects a composite of interview participants in Dr. Dunigan’s dissertation research, incorporating direct quotes as a means to convey authenticity of voice. The men’s stories capture themes of everyday experiences, challenges in accessing education, and complexity of relationships. We are enriched by the sensitivity and humanity, the acceptance of tragedy and the triumph of each who overcomes adversity in their own way. As we encounter how each makes meaning of their life and experiences, we are reminded that, for these men, life is not as enduring as the Mahogany tree.<br /><br />Following the stories, readers are invited to discuss and reflect on a series of questions proposed by Dr. Dunigan. This format makes We Are Not Mahogany an exceptional resource for book clubs, high school and college courses, and any discussion on culture. An abundance of themes, including but not limited to what it means to be male, relationships, experiences at different life phases, cross cultural assumptions, access to education, and beyond generate rich discussion opportunity.<br /><br />The next section of the text provides clear and accessible insight into the otherwise complex requirements of dissertation research. Amongst the components, Dr. Dunigan shares the value of the research, his process, and what additional research could add in the future.<br /><br />The book concludes with contextual information on Uganda.<br /><br />And now a moment for the personal. In full disclosure, Dr. Nathaniel Dunigan is a colleague. Nathaniel neither knows I purchased his book, nor that I planned to post a review. As members of a community who study leadership through many lenses, I’ve shared classes with Nathaniel. Through various encounters and collaborative efforts, Nathaniel’s thoughtful insight and his dedication, passion, caring and service demonstrate commitment to everyday, authentic leadership. I recommend We Are Not Mahogany not because I call it’s author a friend, but because this book offers the potential for boundary crossing conversation. By choosing simplicity and an easy writing style, Nathaniel has translated dense and robust academic research into an accessible read that moves quickly to the opportunity to discuss the very personal experiences of life as a Ugandan male. In addition to reading and generating learning through discourse, I invite you to explore AidChild.org, NathanielDunigan.com and DrDunnigan.com to learn more about the author and the amazing nonprofit work of Aid Child.

The main character was interesting, though tried too hard to be 'different'. Premise was really cool, and I wish it had been explored more.

Where it falls short however, is the entire plot is given away in the synopsis and the ending is a little too neat–a little too packaged.<br /><br />I’m going to start with the things I did like. It’s got a very Alice In Wonderland, mirror flip-turned-upside down vibe going on. From the first page the author leaves the reader unsettled. Something’s coming, and it’s really hard to pin point just what is going on. I think what makes this really effective is that it’s not just one thing, but a group of things, stacking on top of each other. When Josie and Jo switch places, I think the story really starts to shine. The glaring contrast between the two girls really gives light to the ‘good twin v bad twin’ battle. Though in this case they’re doppelgangers. I figured out one of the twists early on, after Josie alters her appearance to look more like Jo.<br /><br />The story doesn’t really pick up until after the switch, when Josie learns that there’s more to Jo’s world than the girl had initially let on. Josie for a few chapters flounders, trying to get her footing and deal with the people who look just like those she left in her own universe, but act so very different. The characters are different enough that they stand out and separate from their alternates. One of the very obvious differences in Jo’s world is the introduction of the Nox. I really would have loved to see more about them, rather than the flash bang description and then a rather disturbing scene further along in the book.<br /><br />One of the things that I did really enjoy is nothing was exactly what it seemed. Everyone had their own agendas and secrets. I did see the major twist coming from a mile away, but it didn’t detract from the enjoyment of the book.

I had a hard time connecting with Katora at first, finding her a bit too whiny and indecisive, but as the book goes on and the story progresses she starts to grow and change. The group accompanying her on her quest to retrieve the flowers is made up of family and the very attractive son of a magical mapmaker. Katora and Hirsten have great chemistry and their relationship unfolds slowly, in fact Katora refuses to acknowledge her own feelings for the boy until after the quest is over.<br /><br />This is a high fantasy book, the world has humanoid creatures, and other beings that are less than humanoid. Magic is a way of life, used in the healing elixirs that Katora's family produces, the magic in the map-maker's craft. The map is one of my favorite things in this story. The map makers have the ability to attach memories to various locations and they play out like movie scenes for those who view the map. Magic is also used as a weapon used by the antagonists who are trying to stall Katora and her group from getting to the flowers.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book.

I baked a box mix from King Arthur Flour, box mix by Hodgson Mill, America Test Kitchen Brownie Recipe from their book &#34;The How Can It Be Gluten Free Cookbook #1&#34;, and one from this book.  By far the recipe from this book was the best.  The brownies held together, had an excellent flavor and texture, and didn't gum up ('too fudgey&#34;). The America's Test Kitchen recipe came in as a close second, and were easier to make because you only have one flour mixture to pre-make, but the flavor and texture weren't as good.  The box mixes were both so bad, there is no comparison.]<br /><br />I repeated efforts with the Devils food cake, but this recipe came in 3rd (and the cake size is 6 inches-what's up with that.

Truly a delicious cake with great texture.  2nd place was a mix by King Arthur, and with frosting this would be an acceptable option (King Arthur Gluten Free Chocolate Cake Mix, 22 Oz)<br /><br />There are 5 flour mixtures in this book to pre-mix, and many recipes use a combination of the flour mixtures for each recipe.  For example the brownies used 2 Tble of flour mixture #1 and 1/4C of flour mixture #4 ;  the Linzer cookies only used flour mixture 2;  the cake used flour mix #3 (1.75 oz) plus 1 Tble of Flour #1 (I substituted because it was used for dusting the pan).

The language was over done; one long wandering sentence after another, stuffed with metaphor and useless imagery. It was as if she was desperately trying to create depth, power, emotion, and meaning that just wasn't there. This book could have shaved off 100 pages, easy.<br /><br />Second, the sense of time is a mess. As soon as the traveling duo reach their destination, all sense of timeline is gone. Their experiences there imply they have been there a long time, months even, yet it will eventually say it's the eighth day!<br /><br />Third, the religious aspect, I felt, was repeatedly forced with no apparent reason. Their rituals were simply ridiculous and meaningless with no contribution to the story.<br /><br />Fourth, the characters were weak. T. Ray especially, but I was disappointed overall. It's nice the author doesn't have any personal experience with child abuse, but she should have at least done some research on the matter. This author needs to go back to the drawing board.<br /><br />Fifth, the attempt at a parallel with excerpts of bee facts at the beginning of each chapter, was also completely lost. I'm assuming that was her intention, as I said, it was lost. And I truly wasn't interested enough to look for the tie-in.<br /><br />I was groaning through this book, frustrated with the protagonist, just wanting her to get on with it, and forcing myself to finish quickly so it would be over with.<br /><br />I feel it's a weak book, lacking from any sort of reality check.

It exists very clearly in the brilliant mind of George R R Martin.<br />The characters are real and well developed ~ their circumstances/dilemmas/choices/consequences are plausible.  Because they are so clearly understood by Mr Martin, it is easy for us, as readers, to forget they are only figments of somebody else's imagination.<br /><br />The cons ~ The books are very long and honestly could be edited.  Do they \"need\" to be edited?  Well ~ that depends on perspective ~ They definitely could be edited without losing much in my opinion, but for those who crave the extra details or have a different favorite character than I do, then perhaps not so much.  I personally didn't care for EVERY perspective or every character.  I found myself actively seeking chapters that were from my preferred characters and skipping others ~ only to return to those skipped chapters, after I'd read all my favorite characters.  Admittedly, not the most ideal way to read a book.  One of the things I am noticing as I/we anticipate book 6 ~ is that most everyone I know who is reading this series has a different favorite character.  This is what fascinates me the most about Mr Martins work.  That is how clearly imagined these characters are.  So, maybe it shouldn't be edited further.<br /><br />*SPOILER*<br />One of the things I like best about Mr Martin's work is that you really can't accurately guess which direction the story is heading, which is what makes his work so tantalizing.  Sure, I grieved when Ned died, but it set the story in motion.  I have always hated where the hero or heroine is left to die, by his or her nemesis in what should clearly be an impossible to escape situation, only to escape or be granted clemency at the last moment.  To be given a 2nd or 3rd chance to win.  Really?  What nemesis in real life is going to let you live to try to thwart them 2 or 3 or 4 times?

Better yet, just throw your money in the trash, make up a bunch of stupid and unbelievable situations that no one will believe, play the victim, and claim you read the book... I promise you'll be more intelligent for doing so.  I'll rate both the Kindle edition formatting and the &#34;story itself...<br /><br />Starting with the formatting, I'm disappointed.  I couldn't get over the number of errors.  Nothing was so bad that you couldn't read it, unfortunately, but it had many misplaced punctuations (random periods in middle of sentences, random commas, odd spacing, etc.) which were on at least 40-50% of the pages; plus broken words and/or misused characters [examples - a way (instead of away), some one (instead of someone), and many, many more]; plus it would use numerals instead of letters at times.  An example is at one point the author gave a &#34;secret operation&#34; the name AI (capital I, which in kindle text has the parallel lines on either end of the character), or was it A1, or was it Al (little L)?  We'll never know because all were used at various times.  And this was not isolated.  The word &#34;all&#34; was spelled a11 at times the letter e was replaced with a 3 sometimes.  Then there was sentence structure in conversations.  If two people were conversing, instead of each of their statements, questions, etc. being presented as separate lines, sometimes they were all in one paragraph.  Luckily, they were never complex, so you could still follow.  But all of this was even inconsistent.  Sometimes the formatting was just fine for several pages, then it wouldn't be for a while.  What did all this show me?  That Amazon bought (or performed) a digitally transferred copy without good quality control, yet they had no problems charging me a nice price for crappy work.<br /><br />But worse was the story... There WERE parts that were believable.  But it's things publicly available in newspapers from the late 60s and early 70s regarding Israel.  And this isn't even when this guy claims to have served in the Mossad!  He tells you that he's repeating something &#34;told&#34; to him by another &#34;top-level&#34; agent, but it looks like its straight from a magazine with a little of his simplicity thrown in to dumb it down.<br /><br />The presentation of virtually everything is too simple to be believable.  One is most definitely left with the impression that if someone were to serve as one of the most covert agents in the world, at an intelligence agency considered by many, even its peers, as a pinnacle organization, then the language would at least be less stupid... yes stupid.  Conversations like:<br /><br />He answered the phone, &#34;Hello.&#34;  BOOM!  The bomb went off.<br /><br />It was like something out of a comic book.  Just awful.  And worse, it wasn't even believable half the time.  Any person with an ounce of common sense would not be &#34;deceived&#34; into some of the implausible situations presented.<br /><br />This guy did nothing to help the Jewish race's image, either.  His relationships at &#34;the institute&#34; are presented in a jealous manner that makes him, not them, seem petty and in the end you simply don't believe him that all these people are that bad (or incompetent) because he doesn't have a single person standing up for him.  He's betrayed by everyone, so they are all painted to be incompetent, or homosexual, or philanderers, or cheats, or thieves, etc.  No one is right except him, and that's not believable as I've stated because his stories are just simple drivel that aren't even that exciting!<br /><br />Now, a friend of mine who has similar tastes in reading recommended this book to me.  He talked about how much he enjoyed it.  You'll have to excuse me while I go pummel him.  I know some people will still read this book despite my recommendation.  I apologize in advance that I was unable to convince you otherwise...

The main character, in my opinion, would never have survived as long as he did popping off to some of the folks he did.  Also, some characters (such as the brother) could have been developed a little better.<br /><br />Finally, towards the end, I felt Mr. Lehane was just either rushing or wrap things up a little too neatly... kind of like a Hollywood ending.  Maybe he's hoping for a movie deal.<br /><br />It could have been five stars, but the ending was definitely predictable for me.  And yet this isn't always a detractor.  For example I give &#34;Day of the Jackal&#34; five stars even though in the beginning of the book I knew Charles De Gaulle lived well beyond the period of the story, but Frederick Forsyth's writing had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.  Lehane had glimpses of that in this book, and there were certainly some surprises, but the ending just felt lazy to me.<br /><br />Please understand that I did enjoy this and do still recommend this book!

It is possible to construct an engaging version of knowledge that delves into the personal details of everyone involved, but not in a survey of subjects. It's like your spouse recounting a day at work, and starts by telling you every song that played on the radio during the commute. Six hours later you're at the part where lunch is eaten. Eventually they get to the part where you asked how their day was, and the story continues.  At that point you don't remember anything they said and just want it to end.
