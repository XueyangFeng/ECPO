I had it on the 360 but it never got all the DLC or updates that the PC did, so when I saw it was coming out for the Xbone with all the maps included I had to get it. That was a mistake.<br /><br />There are some issues with the voice chat, but that can be worked around by being in an XBL party and chatting there. When you try and pick your heist online, in game it's called Crime.net, the game locks up for few moments every 10-15 seconds seconds, but that is more of an annoyance then anything. The real issue is trying to join games online: you can't. When you go to Crime.net and see a game that someone is in that you want to join, you select it then on the next screen you can join it. If you try and join, it locks up for a few seconds then boots you back to the main Crime.net screen with an error message stating you can't join the game.<br /><br />You can't play with people online.<br /><br />You can start a game and invite people, and be invited by others, but if you have no friends with the game or none are online when you are, you will not be able to play with others.<br /><br />There is a single player game of course, but you only get 2 AI players and they can do nothing except shoot and be shot. So good luck hauling bags of jewels to the escape van, it's all on you.<br /><br />If the game worked it would probably get 5 stars from me. The state it is in now, it gets 1.<br /><br />Oh, and as of this review it's been out in the US for about a week and there is still no patch. It was also released in the UK even earlier and there is still no patch. The previous console versions were never updated and never got the DLC that they promised players, which makes me wonder if they are going to do the same for current gen consoles now. Take the money and run? I hope not; my fingers are crossed that the game gets fixed.<br /><br />I will update my review if things change.<br /><br />*** UPDATE***<br /><br />The game was patched! Finally! Yes! It no longer freezes when you try and join games online. Well, it doesn't freeze every few seconds on the Crime.net screen anymore.

I have a high end pair of the a50s that I love. Kiddo is not ready for something that pricey, but he would be better off with a wireless headset for distance learning. He has to get up and get papers and such that the wire has become an issue. When these popped up for review I jumped on the opportunity.<br /><br />Fit and Feel:<br />My first concern was unnecessary, they fit my 8 year old on the smallest size just fine and are light weight so he isn't bothered by them. My husband was able to adjust them out to fit his head as well, so I would say these fit a wide range of head sizes. They really do make you look like a Transformer as another reviewer stated, but at kiddo's age that was a plus not a minus. If they weren't bright white it probably wouldn't be so noticeable. He liked the soft ear cuffs, I found them to be okay. Not super plush but not super cheap feeling either. While being light for him was a plus, I found the headset to feel a bit plasticky and flimsy for the price range. He and I agree to disagree on that one.<br /><br />Sound:<br />I like that he can still hear me when he has them on. These are more of a muffled \"open\" headset than a noise blocking \"closed\" headset. If you want to block out the world around you, these are not for you. If you want to still hear people talking and what's going on around you, these are good for that.<br /><br />Sound was just okay. A bit tinny but in this price range most are going to be. At least they aren't over done with artificial bass to make up for it. If you like a rich bass check out Sennheiser, but expect to pay a bit more for it too. The mic was okay sound wise. It didn't pick up much background noise, but it did oddly clip off your last word in both Zoom and Discord. That might be a sensitivity issue on those programs end more than the headset, but it was odd that it did it with both. Our other headsets didn't.  I love the flip up mic, I've heard enough people eating while not on mute to wish that it was a mandatory feature :)<br /><br />Connectivity:<br />Here is where much of our issues stem from. I was willing to go 4 stars up until this point. But, the dongle is a train wreck. First of all there are no included instructions on how to use it and most of the online instructions are for the transmitter version not the dongle. So you will have to dig a bit to find instructions how to set it up. That is unacceptable in my opinion. It is not just pop it in and use your headset, there is a process...<br /><br />Also, the dongle plug is too loose to stay in the usb port securely. It jiggles in his laptop, my computer, both of our usb hubs. I popped it into the PS4 and while slightly tighter still looser than I'd like. It also sticks out a bit over 2 inches when plugged in and easily gets knocked out. It also constantly loses its settings and is a royal pain in the behind. Most likely we got a dud, perhaps trying to get a replacement dongle would fix the connectivity issues, but in all honesty it's just too big to have poking out the side of a kid's laptop.<br /><br />TL;DR<br />Faulty dongle and flimsy plastic feel make this mid-range wireless headset a bit of a dud. Sound is tinny but okay, mic is fine and flip to mute is amazing, battery life was as expected. Fits an 8 year old all the way up to a full grown man. Bulky but light weight.

I ran a sound check and these picked up bass at the very limits of human hearing, which is quite impressive for an $80 pair of headphones. The mic was crystal clear and did a better job of picking up my voice and blocking background noise than my Sennheisers. Playback of my voice was true, which means if you are looking for a mic that adds a richness and depth that isn't actually present in your voice, this isn't gonna do that. Your voice will sound like... you.<br /><br />The only time I got any static was adjusting the volume when testing for bass, so the drivers were being stressed. Otherwise the volume wheel didn't produce any static.<br /><br />If you want full noise cancellation these aren't going to get you there.

Personally I found these to be the perfect amount of noise cancelling, I like to know that if someone needs my attention they don't have to tap me on the shoulder to do so. Just shout above a normal speaking voice.<br /><br />These are very comfortable to wear, not too heavy but not flimsy light. The ear cups are a standard size, if you have large ears and struggle with headsets in general, you may struggle with these. But I would not call them smaller than average. They were a bit warm though.

In their heyday they were in the $250 range (although they are half that price now, oh technology why do you hate my wallet so much). Anyway, I figured they would be the best set on hand I could test against. Both sets were tested on my system with a dedicated sound card (soundblaster Z) and on my hubby's system without a dedicated sound card. I tested for PC use only, so if these are for an xbox keep that in mind.<br /><br />Need for dedicated soundcard: First off, while the Senn's require the soundcard to pull enough power and not crash my computer, the Astros proAmp thing either compensated enough to not need one, or this headset is fine without a sound card. Either way, I did NOT need a dedicated soundcard for the Astro's.<br /><br />Overall sound quality: ok the Senn's sound slightly richer. Not above and beyond but the sound seems \"warmer\" and more immersive. I'm not saying the Astro's were bad, they passed all the sound tests I ran with flying colors, pulling in a wide range of super low bass and super annoying high frequency. I'm just partial to the Senn's, but the Astros were excellent in their own right.<br /><br />Microphone: Ok this is where the Astros shined. They isolated the noise better, voice was much clearer, and they triggered Discords auto-enable flawlessly. My Senn's often clip the start of my words even on the highest sensitivity.<br /><br />Muting: Going with the Senn's on this one, flip mic to mute is just awesome. Astros have an inline mute, that you slide. When muted the LED lights on the proAmp turns red which is a nice visual to know you are muted. Flip up mic is more of a preference, but I’ve heard enough drama in discord from people forgetting to mute than it’s a life choice more than a preference :P<br /><br />Fifth, comfort: Senn's win this one with a caveat, they are a lot warmer. All that super cush comes at a price, they make your head hot after a bit. The Astros weren't as squishy soft, but they are better ventilated and lighter.<br /><br />Conclusion: Compared to my Senn’s I say they average out to being equals. Sound is great, the mic is amazing, and all the replaceable parts on the Astros incase they wear out make these a really great set. The only real negative is the instruction sheet. IT IS AWFUL. Seriously they wrote it in like 3pt font in light grey. They have a diagram on one side that is rather pointless and HUGE, then the actual instructions on the back are super tiny. If I were writing a review for instructions alone this would be 2 star review. Thankfully its for the headset, so I’m only dinging them one star for the terrible instructions, lack of cush on the padding, and the price point. For $250 gaming headset you gotta hit all the categories out of the park.

Slowly opens up and have a 4K, HDR screen with 120hz its awesome and really adds to the game. The quick version of the story without giving too much away, the protagonist passes away and a spirit takes over his body and other spirits appeared that sweeping threw the city causing death. Something supernatural seems to be happening and the spirit that enters your body, is trying to help.<br /><br />The protagonist eventually gains powers like the Ability to shield himself with an energy orb, detach the the spirit by hitting them with energy and multiple other powers like being able to push them away, you can also swap abilities on the fly. I'll be honest I'm only one hour into the game and I enjoyed a lot but I've been trying to space up my gaming time. It's worth the money if you're looking for something different. Also has limited exploring inside cities. With areas that need to be opened and stores to 'upgrade' etc.<br /><br />I was surprised with the 120hz option, my TV is capable of it but generally I don't like using it because the colors take a hit, even though the game plays smooth. This is mostly due to the PlayStation five actually limiting the speed of the HDMI connection which eventually will be fully unlocked in the future I believe. But for right now it's locked. Normally I would complain about this because it was implemented in Uncharted remaster and even though the gameplay was smooth ,the color didn't look as bright. (never used it, but option was there)<br /><br />Now in this game, colors and details are not effected. Even with multiple game modes. It also has and uses VRR if you have a capable tv. They even have 6-7 game play modes. Like normal, performance, resolution, VRR, 120hz and combinations of VRR+120hz or resolution+120hz etc. I started playing using 120 Hz/with resolution mode and there was no noticeable difference between resolution mode and 120 Hz plus resolution mode other than 120 Hz/resolution was very smooth feeling.

I never played any of the previous games because I always saw them as way too cartoony and none of my friends had them so I never was able to test try it.<br /><br />I decided to pull the trigger and buy the PlayStation 5 version finally got around to playing it now and beat it within one week and platinum. The animations are good it looks like a living Pixar game, especially when you're walking around towns, everything is active, and constantly moving, beautiful looking game and the controls are extremely responsive. I'm happy that I bought it for the PS five. It does have a 120hz mode for anyone that has a television that supports it. The animations and everything become very smooth but other than that it does full solid 4K with 60 frames per second. (fidelity mode, not 120hz)<br /><br />The story's pretty straightforward, the villain takes a weapon that could open portals to other dimensions and accidentally breaks it distorting time and space pulling enemies and people from different dimensions. You have to go and rebuild the item, as well as fight the guy off there are some twists and turns that I'll keep hidden for story reasons. The game is very flashy and it's very audio centric. I really enjoyed the tournament stage at the robot bar location. They give you goals to reach while fighting multiple enemies in a free for all. I like the fact that in the middle of the game as you're fighting through stages or if battling bosses you can open a portal that'll help you teleport to the location rapidly to avoid incoming attacks or simply move around quicker.<br /><br />Completely worth the money even if you're giving it away as a gift.

It also features a little bit of comedy randomly thrown in there and your character does talk and you can choose between a woman or a man with various different types of skin tone or hairstyles. Including the ability to alter the voice.<br /><br />Storyline wise without giving much away I'll leave you with the basics it's a typical Greek adventure storyline the gods have magically disappeared, you have to find them again it it's a puzzle dungeon crawler, as well as open world so you're free to go anywhere you can accidentally venture into the wrong area being underleveled then die rapidly and you can follow the main storyline and slowly progress ahead getting stronger.

If you like game like Erica on the PlayStation 4 you'll like this one. It's basically a moving film / game the only real control is when you're moving around in between certain areas to get from point A to point B but generally don't expect a lot of action. it's like watching a film with some interaction here and there but 90% of the interaction is decision making and some real in real time in mid battle. For example if a battle is taking place you control the options of each character individually you have the opportunity to change the outcome of the story based off your decisions they also have a meter to show the friendship interaction between people or if you trusts them which also builds on the story.<br /><br />The game has various outcomes based off your decisions so it does have high replay value the only thing is chapter select overrides everything. So if you decide to change your selection on stage three , everything from stage 3 and up is completely deleted and you have to replay and there's about 22 chapters I believe. Everything requires split second decision making based off difficulty level and you can have people pass away in the game without even making it to the end so you do have the option of saving some.

The games a decent addition to the series. The scenario is like most Atelier's, localized problems in the kingdom/city etc with Alchemy. I'd say i'm almost half way threw, a friend said there are a total of 11 chapters, 10 and then the final chapter (11).<br /><br />Like all Atelier games, you create items, bombs etc using alchemy after figuring out a recipe from collection, upgrading, being given it or reading inside a book you found/bought. To summarize without giving anything away. Like most there is a friend system, the more you interact with some characters using events.<br /><br />The last Atelier I played was Ferris, in this one, the map system when pulled up can directly move you to that location. Unlike past ones that you move in a board style connection. This one you select and instantly there for events vs it being random pop up/conversations. Locations in maps, Lets say 'woods' will have 2 locations connecting. You cannot select the 2ndary route, only the main path (woods) than locate the other. There are also worlds inside paintings. So the map/exploring system has variety even outside the castle seems tiny, it makes up with worlds inside of paintings.<br /><br />The recipe system gives clues on what you need to do to 'figure out' a new one. It can be collecting items, or leveling things to a % or added bonus. Like most, eventually you find or can buy books that teach you.<br /><br />The fighting system is different. You control 3 people at a time out of 6.  The 3 in-front you control like normal, attack, item etc while the 3 behind are supportive. lets say you do a special, the guy supporting the other does his right after its turn. The 3 in-front takes the damage, while the ones in supportive wont, or lose MP. You can switch the formation before or in the middle of the fight to have the other reset and gain MP/HP back. Some are trigger by special events, like use a bomb that causes burn/fire, will make the support person ignite them. Its kinda fun but takes a little getting use to. Also, each person has their own combination team up.<br /><br />Story wise, it like most Ateliers, does not deal with end of the world scenario. Focused on people, story and friendships and localized issues. Its a nice break from all the end of the world scenarios type games out now. In other words, light hearted. Lydie/Suelle is not my favorite Atelier, but the story decent and made me get back into the series and buying the next one. There are NO TIME LIMITS like old games. Its been removed after the Totori game. So there is no end game, if you don't complete things within X amount of years.<br /><br />I rated it a 3. The only thing I felt was that I explored less and walked less than past ones. Past Ateliers walking around the city was sorta needed to get an idea where everyone/thing was at. So you felt pulled into the world. This one, shows events on maps, which means you can instantly walk to that location, which removes me from physically moving around the town/maps. Some might like that, I couldn't really connect with locals in the town or the events because I didn't have to walk and the game gave away where I needed to go next. This made me feel like I could teleport to a location vs walk like past games. I think it was made this way, but hopefully the next one allows you to explore more. The games good if you like the Atelier series, its a decent addition.<br /><br />In the city, you can directly go to events which tend to be marked on the map. This allows you to avoid constantly walking inside the city to go a location. Sometimes you may want to walk around, pick up items or chat with people.

I tested these on a computer with no special enhancements or 'effects' and they have excellent sound. The volume goes up pretty high too.

It feels high quality, heavy as in well built but not overly heavy while wearing. It looks and performs like a premium device.

They also seem to have fixed the complaints from the older models. The problem for me was the controller of the Playstation 4 that it plugs into. NOT THE HEADSET. The controller lacks a powerful amp built in for headphones.<br /><br />What ends up happening is the high quality, volume levels, bass etc all take a dive. It ends up under performing because the controller does not have a built in amp or DAC to feed it power, so the controller feeds it compressed bluetooth audio on top of not having a built in amp. The difference in sound quality on a computer, sound system and even my LG v20 smartphone (which has a Hi-Fi Quad DAC) is like night and day.

About half way threw the game I found out there are multiple endings around 26 and it kinda pushed me away from replaying everything from the start, (I have a backlog of games) but later I found out that they dont require a full 26 game playthrough unless its the main, main, game. (Like game A,B and C) (3) But they are played from another perspective, have not started the 2nd play through yet, saving it for the weekend.<br /><br />I also found out that some endings stack on your save file. For example, eat a fish that was considered poisonous and you die. Ending the game, but starting from the last save file. (Save before eating it). It saves that ending to your save file, showing which one you saw, but not ending the ability to finish the game like normal. The side endings are smaller text written. Not the main, main, ending. Just a &#34;what if&#34; sorta deal.<br /><br />I'm not gonna be heavily critical of the game, since I have no knowledge of the previous games (how they fight, map layout, system etc to compare it too) but I bought primarily because it was designed combat wise by Platinum Games. I'm a fan of thier fighting system from Bayonetta, this Nier game and the original DMC 1. I will try to be more objective. Graphically its a personal opinion. It's not a Horizon Zero Dawn, but to me the graphics are passable. I'm also using this on a PS4 PRO so the frame issues are non existent.<br /><br />*Negatives:<br /><br />*The first half of the game's open world you lack the ability to fast travel. Which means you have to walk from point A-C every single time. Which makes the game feel like its dragging. You can run, and later you get the ability to teleport to a location or use animals. This isn't a full negative, I know the previous games normally had large open worlds, I just wasn't use to that and failed to plan my target spots to make the most of the trip. I found myself zig zagging back and forth which made the game drag.<br /><br />*Some might get annoyed by the semi desolate open world. Not till later in the game when more enemies appear.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />*Fighting system is awesome, reminds me of Bayonetta but without the magical feel and wacky fighting attacks. You can combine various weapons in 2 sets and switch on the fly by hitting up. You can also add a heavy weapon into your quick attack slot, and light into hard attack, changing the way the weapon works. This was pretty interesting, since most would use a lighter weapon for light attacks and heavier for heavy hits.<br /><br />*A lot of things to do, upgrade weapons, quest and find out how the weapons system combos into each other.<br /><br />*The story is not that bad. Not the best in the world, but not the worst. You have to find a balance of moving the story forward, while at the same time doing side quest to level up. Keep in mind, I have beaten it 1 time and going for the 2nd and 3rd ending later to get the full experience. From what I saw so far, I enjoyed it.<br /><br />EDIT 3/13/2017<br /><br />So after being curious what the 2nd play through does. I looked into it online and played the first 12 minutes of the game. You play as the guy, and 3rd part as the Android A2. Everything carries over, including quest that you never finished. After thinking about it, since you now know the layout of everything, the play time should be reduced. From what I heard online 8-10 hours. You learn the events from the guys point of view, his missions are different and he has hacking sections. Your levels, items, etc carry over. This also includes unfinished quest.

Last I read over 200 but none of that is needed to finish the game or advance the story, other than help you gain money, level up and grab special items. Some are unavoidable due the fact that you need to complete some quest to move the story along. But for the most part, you can focus on sidequest and the main story (highlighted in red) in your quest selection. You have to balance both because the game can pull you in doing quest after quest and not move the story along. You can choose what to pursue  highlighted red on the map, same for side quest. I know the biggest complaint about this game was the amount of side quest it has but<br /><br /> YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO EACH ONE TO ADVANCE THE STORY.<br /><br />The magic system gets a little getting use to since it can hurt you and the party. You can unlock skills that pull the party away from the main fight, regroup or join you which allows you to use magic without effect everyone else. Those skills will not automatically unlock. You have to use AP points to purchase them. Using those skills in battle is some of the best ways to use magic without hurting the party. Magic also has to be created by the player (in the menu, not a store) you can pick up elements fire, lightning and ice from elemental points scatters all over the map. When you mix them, you can add items like potions etc to give it a boost or dual cast and even attack and heal the party. To get better effects like DEATH, MULTICAST etc you have to add them into the flask before creating them. They even allow you to just highly the item before mixing them and it will show the bonus effects to avoid guessing. I love the fact that when you use magic, the enemy will fry, pulse thunder or have ice cling on them. The environment also gets coated in the magic giving it a real world effect.<br /><br />I started playing the game with update 1.02 and the new one released 12/20/2016 1.03 which fixed a ton of bugs that I never encountered but nice to know they were fixed. The new 1.03 update allows NEW GAME+ which carries everything over. (minus story related items).

You have to meet certain requirements for them to appear and based on location some are more prone to jump in.<br /><br />As for the &#34;long load times&#34; it's really only if you die. As for the &#34;Long car rides&#34; you can quick travel, but you will miss random events since tend to appear while you're in the car. This will also trigger the load screen, but not as long as the initial load time.

I missed Atelier Ayesha, Escha & Logy and Shallie since my PS3 died after Meruru and was upgrading to a PS4 at the time. (Can't comment on the last 3 games). Change of pace, light hearted, story character driven, they removed the time limit system from past games which helps you explore and develop characters without having to time every step and not make the days past. Share Play can be used, as well as streaming. No blocked parts.<br /><br />I'm glad i'm back playing the series. One of the main reasons I like them is the change of pace. It's light hearted game play and nothing overly serious like end of the world scenarios you see in almost every game. Character goals are more important, as well as alchemy and exploring the world and meeting new people. Gust tends to always bring characters from previous games back as cameos. Logy is in this, I know he was from the Escha game and comes back as a sword smith. Pamela has become a recurring character in almost every game (she's also in this). It also helps move the story seeing past characters since you connect with the previous game.. While this may sound tamed or dull to some, it's far from it. It does have special events that pop up that you must beat (monsters, dragons and demons) but story focus is on personal developments and exploring the world around you. It's very story focused with events popping up randomly or on intervals and each person has a 'friendship' meter. Which triggers events tied to them.<br /><br />Can't compare on the last 3 games fighting system but I do know they removed the &#34;limit break&#34; that was present Rorona, Totori and Meruru it was a special skill when a character reached a certain mode which was an ultimate attack and have now fused them into a team type ultimate attack instead on single. Each person does have thier own ultimate, they are just joined by the group present. They still have skills, items like uni bombs, lighting rods etc and the standard, heal, speed up, break, sleep, poison etc. If you're familiar with those (which is standard in most RPGS) it should be simple to jump into. If you're a fan of the series and missed a few games like I did, it should very easy to get use to it again. Alchemy system has been enhanced but for the most parts follows the standard theme. (traits, quality, levels) when mixing. You can still carry over traits like previous games. To people not use to the Atelier series, it may be hard to understand how the story flows since they dont hold your hand, you have to advance the story doing tasks or alchemy but eventually it opens up to character moment to move the story forward. In the status menu section the friendship meter appears in red or black. Some moments in the game require you to talk to characters to trigger events. Most the times it tells you in the &#34;idea section&#34; others you have to walk up to characters. They use a day/time system some events only happen at a specific time. This is not a negative, it just needs some getting use to if you're use to these types of games.<br /><br />Even though I missed the last 3, they still have some of the best music. Everything fits the game perfectly and like previous ones, they include vocal parts on special events. The rest that seem basic, grow on you and you start to appreciate it as time passes. My only regret was not buying the special edition, since I missed the last 3 games I wasn't sure if they could &#34;hook&#34; me again.

Visually, it's impressive. One of the best AAA games out there right now. The story in general once you start it will be impossible to let go of and not finish it. They covered all past games and Nate's adventure around the globe. They show a side of him that deals with everyday life for everyone. Showing his normal life now vs his global treks around the globe. It really makes you see how everyday you wake up like a robot and do the same over and over again and not even notice it. However you see things from his perspective. Anyways, I have not completed the game but currently working on it and in chapter 11 and was blown away by the chemistry all the voice actors have, I would say this surpasses Uncharted 2. The music goes with the flow of what is happening inside the game which really sucks you into the storytelling and action sequences. I have nothing negative to say on it.<br /><br />Multiplayer I was impressed with. Everything in game can be bought or unlocked by using multiplayer points won in game. The only thing is the points unlock items randomly or paying for points to allows you to select them. All stages are free to avoid dividing the community.<br /><br />The MP plays like a mix of The Last of Us and Uncharted 3. You can revive downed allies like TLOU however they have boosters that can be bought in game (gun upgrades, more bombs, helpers etc) I liked the fact that every time you buy an &#34;upgrade&#34; inside the game (RPGs, GUNS etc) they cost more the next time so it avoids being abused. They have  a section that teaches you how to use the new items or moves (hooks, one hit kill charge, bombs , mines etc) standards Deathmatch and capture the flag type modes. They also have a section for ranked matches online instead of friendly. It still 'feels' like an uncharted game when playing online similar to UC2-3.<br /><br />I loved The Last of Us but Uncharted has always been fast pace and I was afraid that they would slow down the online in UC4. This time Naughty Dog found a good mix between fast pace action with timing and semi planing similar to (TLOU) so that made me happy. This time the online is fun and feels challenging not just run and gun.

I wore mine out a week ago playing God of War 3 and I was originally planning on sending them to Sony for a replacement. The rubbers wear out on some Playstation 4 controllers that are first generation.<br /><br />Long story short, delivery was quick, and easy to install. My original were split in the center which created a &#34;lift&#34; on the rubber in the center that could be felt. I was skeptical at first, but after they arrive they fit perfectly. I removed the split rubbers from the old controller by hand. They come right off with no resistance or left over residue. Slide these sideways and they wrap around perfectly. They are slightly loose, but not overly and when playing they stay still. This was probably made that way so you could angle them in from any direction and then straighten them once on. They look nice and make the controller stand out. You could possibly add these on a controller that are not worn out like mine for extra grip.<br /><br />Pros: solid grip, they look nice once on, adding a little flare and originality to your controller. (i'll upload an image)<br />Cons: The only con I can find by being picky would be they can be ripped while putting them on the controller. This can be avoided by simply going slow and angle them sideways when installing.

This was my first entry into the series and a long time Tekken, SF and Soul Calibur fan.<br /><br />Game plays great, models are bright and vivid, what caught my attention more was the interactive stages and how highly detailed they are as well as the deep combo system and move list. Similar to Tekken, yet has it's very own unique play style. I like the fact you have to do the correct input for everything to work rather than buffing moves. If you need to press forward, forward, kick, punch and back. It has to be done precisely. Tekken gave you slight leniency with the input commands, but not DOA. This is not a negative, its a plus. This means your opponent has to know the move commands rather than button smash. This forces anyone picking up a character to know the moves and generally force them to learn the game.<br /><br />The stages at first I was under the impression were dull, until I learn how to smash someone into them. (interacting with them) setting them into motion. Collapsing building floor in mid fight that throws you off the side, barrels that light up setting the environment on fire, electrical ropes in a ring that set off lights and cheering all add to the atmosphere. Some when triggered, can hit a character into them setting off chain of events. In the tiger circus stage you can smash someone into a ring, which forces the tiger to jump thru a hoop hitting you.<br /><br />They have: story mode, arcade mode, vs, tag battle (2 vs 2 swap mid fight) and 7 vs 7 team battle, online mode, training, combo masters, tutorial and spectator mode as well as movie mode and the ability to take and save pictures similar to a photomode on TLOU Remastered.<br /><br />One of the things I enjoyed was the ability to play arcade mode, tag battle, or training and have the PS4 look for an online battle in the background as I played. Than just press and hold options to accept the invite. This can be turned on or off before you start the game. Nice way to unlock costumes and practice, while randomly getting an online challenger instead of going into online mode itself. In online mode, you can select a hosted game or play rank match. The online was stable, i'm running 60 down and 12 up and only had a few minor lagged matches. This should be eliminated if you set preferences online.<br /><br />Each character has their own tutorial and combo tutorial. This makes it easy for you to try new characters out and not get stuck to one.<br /><br />As for the tons of DLC in the PSN store. This is optional clothing. Much better off buying the full game itself, and its cheaper. You have to unlock the clothing by playing, instead of paying to have them unlocked or buying characters. There are some outfits not in the disk, but the majority are unlocks from the disk, characters etc. The core mode on the PSN is only for people that are curious about DOA but would rather not invest in the full game. Each character runs $3.99 and 4 given free out of 32 playable. (as you see much better buying the disk). The disk or full game download also includes trophies, which I read buying core mode and purchasing things seperate doesn't.<br /><br />Characters models are well done, as for the added &#34;breast physics&#34; they have an optional &#34;natural mode&#34; which is a next gen only add-on using the soft engine, &#34;DOA&#34; and &#34;LR&#34; which is exaggerated motion. DOA and LR mode allow you to shake the controller to have the boobs bounce or sway. (depending the direction you shake or move the control). They also included an off mode. In my opinion, turning them off the female characters look like plastic dolls. As for the visual upgrades, characters and backgrounds have a solid look to them, no flickering or random item disappearing as you walk around.<br /><br />Negative: The only negative I could find is the lackluster story mode. They basically did a story mode similar to Injustice Gods among us that linked characters into one big match threw out the story. You play as everyone, but for people like myself with no past history of previous games its hard to connect the non obvious things. As you play each character they give a few sentences of what's going on or who they are. The story mode is entertaining, because it gives a glimpse on what's going on, just not mind blowing.<br /><br />Beyond that it's still a good game and the fighting system is well done. Easy for a beginner, but has an intricate fighting system for pro.<br /><br />WARNING: For people using Shareplay, Koei blocked unlocked movies, and the movies in story mode as you play. You can shareplay with a friend, even play vs mode using shareplay co-op couch mode, but they only allowed you to select a few stages and not all of them or the 2ndary stages. If you plan on letting a friend watch you play story mode, (as I did over the weekend) it blocks the movie for the person you share played with. Letting them only see the fights in story mode. All other modes he can access even if you hand the controller over: (Tag, vs, tutorial etc)<br /><br />I was going to list this as a negative, but it's hardly a negative since the story mode in DOA 5 Last round was not phenomenal, just okay.

IF your into that style of games (Stealth). Not sure if you played any of the old ones but it was considered one of the games that created that style of game play back in the day tied into stealth.<br /><br />Its not the same as dishonored, but they are completely different. Dishonored even on hardest setting was easy. Here, they emphasis stealth. Higher levels hard modes the ability to kill and move list drops further and further or not allowed. Example, Knockouts allowed but no kills. Not be seen, but kills allowed etc..<br /><br />There is no free movement by the way (GTA V style) and exploring is pretty much centered on picking gold, items and loot from people or in closets, safes etc. 1 section may have doors to pick or windows to break in. The game is divided into sections, for example town A, B and C each require a load like old school games. Some may be thrown off by this because loads are pretty long. (not bad, just noticeable) Stages are decently huge. But what makes them feel long is the stealth tied to the game. You cant just free run everything. The guards are murder bots basically. The moment they hear or see you instantly turn murderous and track you.<br /><br />You can run and hide till they lose interest but the pattern on how they walk changes afterwards. Some stages have regular people walking by, who you can steal from behind. Its a quick time event.. But if they notice you and yell robber. (alerting the guards and you get the idea). In terms of openness: they do allow you to climb over crates, up walls if it has the correct marking for wall run and over ledges as long as it looks like it supports a real human could use. (everything). If you see a few crates that a normal human could crawl up on , you probably can too and not limited to the blue scratches on walls. This also extends to rooftops.<br /><br />You can also do typical things like pick up glass and throw it to make a noise and alert others to that area to change the pattern or let you creep behind them. For example, I had to steal a mask. First time I did this was waiting for the guards to change patrols, as they walked to the left and right side, I went in and picked the lock (quickly) getting in. They have a lock pick ability, than you hit a button to lock it and move to the next set of springs to open the door. A misses lock pic will make a sound. The 2nd time I just alerted the guys to all go in one side to get in, 3rd time I noticed the back room was open and snuck in the back-way. I have also heard there was a wall opening too. Being inside a house with people, can last about 30 minutes with no load. Mostly because they are walking back and forth OR sitting and you cant just walk around making noise. There is a \"light\" meter that shows your level of invisibility to someones eye. Pure black 100% hidden. You can walk slowly and not be seen. In a room that I blew out all 6 candles. The guy didn't notice me so he walked back and forth making something with only his candle on two desks lit. (I robbed him from behind twice and stole things around him. Than ran off.) In another save, I alerted him that he knew someone was inside but all candles were off. While he walked back and forth in the room trying to find you. Even than, you are so hidden that you could steal a purse from his back two times in pure darkness as long as he doesn't face you, you are hidden. If the light meter reads \"dark\" you are practically 100% hidden especially with crouch.You also have to be aware of how much noise you make too.<br /><br />Story so far is typical but matches with the settings. Since I am in master mode,its slightly harder. Every difficulty has set rules and one that uses a custom hard setting. You basically pick locks, various safe boxes and that type of stuff like gold from the ground or peoples hidden money. You also have to be rapid and careful because you can trigger warnings. The reason I mentioned dishonored, is because some have said its more fun. Dishonored was based off Thief,(I have heard) but had other elements and was easy. But like I said everyone has an opinion. Thief has a higher difficulty curve even on easy. I am familiar with how Thief plays.. Obviously graphics are good in 1080p. (PS4 at least) Everything you have to buy upgrades like you focus ability, sweep, and in general these things called poppy seeds that enhance vision, see items on the ground from far away etc. Its very slowly pace and careful. No run and gun sections type of things.. At the most run and hide. You can upgrade things like dexterity which allows you to steal two purses from one target in one hit making the quick time event faster. Quicker lock picking ability that lets you imagine the ability to see the locks from the inside to help you unlock them vs using the analog pattern to light up. There are also upgrades to let you walk in areas making less noise or hidden longer etc.<br /><br />You have an ability called sweep, which is the same as a shadow moving across the floor in a sweep formation. Sweep, is similar to Blink in Dishonored. You also have water arrow, fire and rope. (random other stuff) Rope can only be used on specific areas. Water turns off a hanging torch or anything with fire as long as the guards not holding it to allow you to creep by a lit area. You also have side missions aside from the main one. About the sweep ability: if you need to dash from one lit area to another. Sweep makes you a quick shadow blur. You can also sweep in shadows or ducking which gives the look like your materializing forward or backwards. From a first persons perspective, its a duck and dash just quick like a blur. I was able to shadow dash backwards while looking at a cop walking towards me (I was hunched over by a crate). This allowed me to avoid getting up, turn, than run and hide. You also have a watch ability. Basically stare threw his eyes and just watch conversations and walking pattern.<br /><br />Audios good too. Occasionally, the audio seems louder when people are talking. (Hard to tell which room or direction they are in). I am only on stage 4 or 5 as of yesterday. I switched to harder settings to master mode because I wanted more of a challenge from my first play threw. In my opinion it needs to be played harder to get a good feel on people being careful. If a stealth game is to easy, it wont feel like a challenge or like your a real Thief. Easier settings guys don't detect things like voice or walking on glass etc That makes it to easy. Since the stages are semi short divided by sections.. The harder it is, the better and longer the stages feel since you have to be ultra careful. You can pick pocket anyone as long as they have a purse on their side or back. This includes guards. Some stages that require you to be fully 100% undetected while breaking in, if they see you the game re-loads. So far for the most part of the game its not required. (basically, giving you a chance to get in and out but also make mistakes and allows you to run and hide and try again).<br /><br />However it will be awhile to get use to the stuff and you will have to start over a lot till you get the hang of it. Since they have to load the stage again, some might get annoyed by it. BUT when your use to the moves and things he can do to play stealthy. You rarely see a load. They also do a good job on the story by reading threw news paper, load screens or items you pick up like special things stolen. Take a chance on it. I don't really like reading game reviews because many of the guys are so critical that any little thing drops the score and it effects sales of the game or bad word of mouth. People have a tendency to just rules games out for another guys opinion or people rating them nit pick.  I personally have played a lot of games that scored  lower and they were extremely fun and I enjoyed them.", "ParentASIN": "B00CEGCN76", "Timestamp": 1394208670000, "ItemName": "Thief Xbox one", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.2, "RatingCount": 414, "Price": 19.89, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Xbox One", "Games"], "Description": "In \"Thief,\" players assume the role of Garrett, a skilled and solitary thief navigating a troubled city.

The game is incredible.. lets just say, Lara is back the moment you beat the game. (without giving anything away) you will get the same feeling after completion. It really is a mesmerizing game and the PS4 edition blows the last generation one of of the water. if you have a sound system, you will love the audio recording from simple water, rain, thunderstorm and simple gun shots echoing in the woods. They did an excellent job. not just visually. The island itself feels alive.<br /><br />Old Tomb Raider games my thoughts:<br /><br />Tomb Raider stayed the same way even mechanics for years and needed a reboot. 11 games and you don't really know much about her as a character besides the obvious she raids tomb for artifacts. If you have no back ground on a character,  and they barely speak (Lara back than) you have nothing to connect with besides the basic's that she raids tomb. Angel of darkness tried story elements and changed the combat system but way to late in the series that it felt experimental. The game was garbage according to people and is universally the worst Tomb Raider, I felt it was something to new and to late in the series when you trained your fans to play her one way and limited back story. What made Lara good at its time was because there was NOTHING like it back than, especially in 3D models puzzle adventure. However now with HD graphics, realism and top games like Uncharted, Thief etc. You do need to connect with characters.<br /><br />Reboots tend to be looked at with a careful eye,  because many older fans just like how she played and was from the first games..Or connected to a past memory when they played this while a kid.<br /><br />However, they did do her justice in this games story line, music , action and pretty much every category in this new reboot. You connect with Lara and from a video included in the game itself on extra. You see her become who she is. You see her personality get harder, determined and overall back to the old Lara we all know. In mid game you see her change, from simple things like how she lands, talks or walks across gaps, tree limbs etc.<br /><br />I sometimes hear old tomb Raider fans say they understand its a re-boot but than fall right back into the nostalgia trip, and start up with:  \"its not like the old Tomb Raider\", she doesn't duel pistol anymore, to scary, tense, not enough puzzles. I see this like this: The original Tomb Raider game never existed and this is a brand new game. This game will have no connection to the previous games as far as we know. You won't see Natla or Zip or Allister. This is way before the original. Something to show us how Lara became Lara. (trust me you will see it the same way as your playing threw). Some old fans say they understand this, but they really don't, because they start back in the Nostalgia trip wagon of how she usta be and nit pick instead of sitting down and enjoying the game.<br /><br />Sit down as a blank slate if your an old fan and just play it. Puzzles are not presented the same way as older games because of the scenario she is in. (stuck on an island with no real experience). Some are easy, others quick. And foremost, explore. Each area has a list that tells you what optional thing to look for. Relics, documents that explain the story, personal notes and diaries. The diaries explain the game better as in whats going on outside of cut-scenes but people in the island. With relics, Lara makes her own personal comments on them and even have hidden extra info when observing the relics by moving them around.<br /><br />GAMEPLAY:<br /><br />At first she feels limited and bare-bones.. but that all changes as you gain skill points. You can make her go the survival direction, Brawler or hunter. Even possible to have all of them leveled up.  The touch pad is used for a map or lighting torches or turning them off. Controls are solid.. Especially when she starts gaining skills.. Everything just works fluidly like 2nd nature.<br /><br />This is definitely a game i'm glad I waited for the PS4 version instead of getting it last gen. Visually the game is superior graphically like night and day. I have owned every single Tomb Raider game minus the collection. This is the Tomb Raider game in a long time I truly enjoy, she needed a good reboot and they did an excellent job. Very happy its in my collection.<br /><br />WARNING:<br /><br />It is possible to beat the game by just going to story points instead of searching and exploring. If your not familiar on how Tomb Raider works or new to the series, encourage yourself to search. But its not forced on you. This can make the game feel smaller or quick to beat. The old games you had to get everything in the stage to move forward since it was a big puzzle. They never had stage items and towards the end of its life they started to add minor things here and there. This one, everything is optional on the side. This can give an illusion the game is small if you avoid searching for items. Each section has a percentage and main section map with all hidden items. It took me hours to collect many of the items in each section which is marked at 100% when done. But I choose this direction to fully enjoy the game. Instead of rushing threw it. You can back track using the camps which makes it easy to get past items or open areas with upgraded equipment later on.<br /><br />MULTIPLAYER:<br /><br />Its okay.. But remember this game could stand on its own without multiplayer. I have no negative or positive opinion on it. Its wacky and feels tacked on but does have its moment. Just don't buy this game strictly for multiplayer. its mostly a single player experience. Which was the main reason in getting it. It does have multiplayer trophies if your into that. However, this opinion is only based on a hand-full of times I played online. I was hooked on single player but will be online more now that I competed the game at 100%.

I’ve played every Cooking Mama installation since the DS, including the Wii which was amazing. This one is the most aggravating by far. They only implement certain buttons and joysticks in handheld (total missed opportunity considering all the buttons they could’ve used) and they rarely register correctly. There’s no way to adjust sensitivity. It makes it impossible to 3-star all levels. I gave it a 2 rating for the neat graphics. But this will probably be my last Cooking Mama game. The franchise has been nosediving for awhile.<br />Update: As I played the game more I realized that the poor game controls made it impossible to complete some recipes, which meant not being able to unlock more recipes. I was pretty much against the wall at that point and decided to return for a refund. I adjusted my rating to 1 star.

It’s the first time since Mario Odyssey came out that I haven’t been able to put down a Switch game. People who are complaining about the game need to play past the tutorials, because so many options (like motion controls) become available the deeper you get into the game.<br /><br />I love the open world concept of this game—you can run/skate/ride around exploring each resort looking for treasures, taking pics, completing your animal photo collection, practicing your skills, etc. Just the travel methods alone are a blast because each method has its own little set of features—like the in-line skates for example, you can jump and do tricks or grind along rails while you’re heading over to wherever it is you’re going. The ATV, if you work it right, will even climb up certain cliff-sides, which you can't do if you’re walking.<br /><br />When you’re not exploring you can be playing the mini games, which are incorporated into the resorts so well. You want to surf? Head over to Coconore Island to catch some waves. In the mood for some fishing? Go find the fishing instructor on the beach, or better yet, hop on your jet ski and ride into the secret cave for some fishing on the dock. Feel like skiing? Catch a chair lift to take you up the mountain. You can also select the activities from the main menu for quicker access. I’m really impressed with how many mini games they put into this. There is quite a variety, and while the game mechanics can seem repetitive, each sport has its own unique appeal so that you don’t feel like you’re playing the same game over and over.<br /><br />The game doesn’t come without flaws. The graphics aren’t as good as they’re capable of being on Switch. But they’re good enough that my thalassophobia kicks in when I’m scuba diving. The most glaring issue is the camera. They should have let you look around with the right analog stick, but you can’t. It makes no sense considering the right analog stick has no use when you’re exploring. Also, some spots in the open world, like doors to buildings and ladders, can’t be entered or used. Why put a ladder on the side of a building if you can't climb up? Loading screens can take a while. And the map needs to have more information—such as the location of where each activity can be found. Hopefully when, if, they put out the next version of this game they’ll fix all this and make the UI a little more intuitive and streamlined. It stinks having to leave a resort to go to the main menu to view hints and your photo album.<br /><br />Aside from exploring and playing mini-games there are objectives, challenges, records to break, levelling up to get keys so that you can customize your villa, finding the bungee jumping locations, collecting and changing outfits, and the list goes on. Heck, they even put dogs in the game. You can adopt a dog and it’ll run around with you, and he'll bark when you're near a secret. You can select your breed, change it’s size and give it a name to match your dog in real life if you’re anything like me.<br /><br />It’s nice to buy a game that I don’t feel like was a waist of money. Every time I play I discover or unlock something new. I can’t wait to play multi-player with the kids I babysit.

The concept is great, but I don't know if they rushed it before they could fully develop it or what. The new city has four districts each with its own attitude (foodie, artsy, glamour and money). Each district gives you a different genre of neighbors and surroundings. You'll find rundown efficiencies and historical, haunted apartments in the lower/middle class districts and penthouses and glamorous digs in the upper class ones. Each district has a festival or event representative of that district. Within the districts you'll see food stands, contests, new interactions and activities, etc... But here's where they sold us short. Each district only has one business, except for the money district which has two. One has an art gallery, two have karaoke bars and one has a gym and a lounge. That's it! No restaurants, no theatres, no night clubs, no bodega corner stores or cute shops that you'd expect to see in a big city. So while they are on the right track with the concept, they completely missed the mark with the final product. I love the apartments and the city districts. The karaoke bar is cool. There are lots of new food/recipe options. The social media career is neat because you can work from home. But I am just so disappointed that the city districts themselves seem to be incomplete.

I remembered the mini-game of Toad's puzzles from the other Mario game so I was excited to have a full game of puzzles. I expected every level to be contained to a little chunk of land with Toad running around looking for items. But the game creators have really souped it up! Each level is different enough from each other and you don't get bored. For example, one level has you on a mine-cart riding it like a roller coaster while you try to collect your diamonds and coins. There are even boss levels. So, not only is this a puzzle game, but it is an adventure game too!<br />I have two cons however. First, sometimes the angles make it hard to see what you're doing. Because it is so 3D and you have to move the joysticks around to see where you're going - if you don't turn the camera the right way you can find yourself falling to your death. This gets frustrating. Second, the game is really short. There are only about 60 levels and some bonus levels, which may seem like a lot, but the levels really aren't that hard, even when you go back for the extras (like finding the gold mushroom or collecting all the coins). If you don't have a lot of money to spend on games you might want to go for something else to spend full price on and wait til the price on this drops.

I told my brother, who is a Zelda freak and still plays Ocarina on N64, \"You have to buy a Nintendo 3DS just for this game!\" The details are amazing, from the blades of grass to the pollen floating through the air. If you have played Ocarina in a past this will be a new experience for you and an enjoyable way to bring back old memories. If you've never played Ocarina this will be a whole new game for you.

It is a nice change from the Sims 3. Being a quest based game it gives me something to look forward to. There are a lot of improvements in the Sims Medieval that I hope they apply to the Sims 3 with an update - for example the requirement to fulfill certain needs (pee, bathe) is optional and helps improve focus but doesn't have negative affect if not taken care of. Also, time lapse is much more reasonable - instead of taking 3 hours to cook and eat you can get it done in under an hour.<br /><br />I had to knock a star off my rating for various reasons. For one, where are the horses?! The Sims Medieval really needs horses. Also, the quests usually provide you with choices as to which way the story will go and then gives you direction, which is fine, but it's a little too limiting imo. It needs to require a bit more problem solving on behalf of the player, and provide hints if the player needs it rather than literally telling you where to go next. And last, once I finally figured out how to advance to higher levels I realized that it just starts you fresh with the same kingdom, same quests, etc... I don't mind playing in the same kingdom, but the same quests??? C'mon. I know this is to give the player the option to try a quest using alternative outcomes but I feel like I'm going to get burned out repeating quests before I complete all the level advances.<br /><br />I haven't tried the most recent expansion pack because I haven't read good things about it.

After playing SMG 1 I couldn't imagine the game developers possibly being able to come up with the same amount of creativity that they did in the first one; and not only did they manage, they surpassed it.<br /><br />In SMG 2 you get to play with Yoshi, which adds a new element to the game. And with Yoshi comes his fruit which has different effects on him when he eats them, the same way mushrooms and flowers have on Mario. There are also a lot more opportunities to play with Luigi in SMG 2, as Luigi has a few skills that even Mario doesn't.<br /><br />I would go as far as to say I like this one better than the first, simply because of the layout. SMG 1 took place on a space station that could be confusing when trying to locate galaxies (located in rooms). SMG 2 is very basic, being contained on a spaceship shaped like Mario's head which flies to the different galaxies. Therefore, they were able to bring back the map view (think Super Mario 3) which makes it much easier to locate and reach your galaxies, as well as see which ones you've completed.<br /><br />The only con I can come up with for Super Mario Galaxy 2 is the fact that some of the levels are ridiculously hard (I hate the clones).

I wouldn't even pay half price for this game, it's that bad.<br /><br />I agree with a previous reviewer who said The Sims 3 DS tries to be too much like The Sims 3 for PC. It is very much a dumbed down version, keeping the basics of the Sims 3 such as building skills, earning reward points, completing missions, etc... but it is so limiting being on the DS that there's no fun in it. The graphics are so poor you can't really see what your sim is doing, whether they're painting a picture or cooking a meal, you have to watch from a very limited angle above and use your imagination. And the waiting is absolutely agonizing. There's a fast forward button, but it doesn't speed it up that much. When my sim goes to work it still takes 7 real-time minutes, even in fast forward, for my sim to emerge and be able to go on to the next task. So you're left to sit and watch your sim's work building or get up and do something else during the that time. And who wants to get up and find something else to do for 7 minutes when they're in the mood to play video games?<br /><br />One thing that I've loved about the Sims for consoles in the past, such as Bustin' Out, the Urbz, and even the Sims 2 for DS, is that they are not like the PC versions, rather they have a beginning and an end and are filled with quests that help you progress to the end of the game. When I saw they made a Sims 3 for DS I was hoping it would follow in its predecessors footsteps. But it is evident that they were simply trying to provide a hand-held version of the PC game, and it is a huge FAIL in my opinion. At least I now know that if the Sims 3 for Wii is anything like this to not even bother, because obviously nothing will ever be as good as the PC version.<br /><br />I saw the negative ratings before I bought this game, but my love for the Sims got the best of me.

Pure Hidden is fun, it's not addicting to me because I don't find picture-find games addicting, but it is a game that I've enjoyed playing. The scenes which hide the pictures are different than what you find in a typical picture find game. The main pictures are gorgeous. I would even say they are works of art that one might frame and put on their wall. They aren't basic scenes with images of items cut out and scattered all over the place, rather they are well thought out and designed to cleverly hide the items within them, making them quite challenging. So far I've had to use the cheat tool to find at least one of the items in almost all of the scenes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel like the overall setup of the game was a total miss. Working to complete your gallery of scenes that you have finished (which you can install as a desktop background after you do) has nice appeal, but there is A LOT of filler in between the picture-find scenes, which consists of mini-games and mini-puzzles, some of which are completely pointless. For example, the \"decorate your bathroom\" activity--this one shows up multiple times as a \"mini-game\" but each time you're only given an option of one item to be put in a predetermined place, and ding, you're done for that one and it moves you on to the next puzzle. Totally pointless. Some of the mini-games have a really neat concept, like bursting the bubbles to play a song, but there is no goal whatsoever, and after about 15 seconds you get bored after realizing there's no challenge to it and hit next to move on, which you could have done in the first 5 seconds of the mini-game. A few of the mini-games are implemented with some really innovative ideas, like the \"find the difference games\" where you use your mouse to turn the 3D image and look at it from all sides. Now if there had been more of these in place of the pointless mini-games, then I think Pure Hidden would have been much more fulfilling.

There are different grid patterns for each level, bombs that blow things up in a fantastic fireworks-like display, flower poppers that will save your life, aggravating frogs that will end it, and the overall goal of metal plates that have to be removed before you can advance to the next level. These are all additions Monarch applies to make this game very enticing and addicting. You will play for hours and your hand, or even your whole arm, will go numb if you're not careful.

The Sims 3 is a HUGE improvement over The Sims 2. Maybe people's computers aren't strong enough, or maybe their expectations were too high, but I can't imagine wanting to go to back to playing The Sims 2. The Sims 3 is not as good as the Sims 2, it's better.<br /><br />The Sims 3 is not a totally different game from the Sims 2, if it were, then it wouldn't be the Sims. Rather, it's The Sims with improvements in the game play and graphics. EA seems to have removed many of the bugs that we found in previous Sims games. For example, having the Sims react with more common sense, like taking the shortest route to the bathroom, or waiting to perform a task if there's a hold-up  (rather than arguing with you and forgetting the command altogether). Now that's not to say that there isn't an occasional glitch where a Sim will get distracted and forget their command, but it's minimal compared to how it was in The Sims 2.<br /><br />No this game does not come with all the extras like seasons and being able to take vacations, but this is only the BASE game, and expansions are soon to come I'm sure. There is a lack of objects in buy mode (also sure to come in expansions), but I think the best improvement to the game, the Design Tool, makes this disadvantage hardly noticeable. I spent hours using the Design Tool making furniture and decor match, something that was near impossible in The Sims 2. If you like to decorate your house, you will be in heaven with this new feature.<br /><br />Another great improvement is the user interface. Although it is very similar to the Sims 2, there are some aspects that make it so much more user friendly. For example, you can change your view, going from straight overhead to almost underneath by just clicking an arrow. This is so much easier to me then having to hunt through all the different buttons that performed these tasks in the Sims 2.<br /><br />The graphics do not bother me at all. I can't figure out why everyone says the Sims look freaky. I have my graphic settings on medium, and I quite enjoy the unique facial features of all the Sims. They are much more realistic and make it easier to get involved with each Sims' own individuality.<br /><br />I'm not running a fantastic computer, but it is a new computer. I think anyone running a new computer (within the last few years) should have no problem playing The Sims 3 on their system. Yes a good graphics card is in order for the best graphics and performance, but it ISN'T necessary to just play the game. As long as your system meets the requirements, you shouldn't have an issue.<br /><br />There are a few improvements I expected to see in the Sims 3 (hence my 4 star rating), such as being able to assign certain objects in the house to certain Sims, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed to see them in updates and expansion packs.

You fashion your character to your own liking, then have him or her wander around a carnival from booth to booth where you play games and try to win tickets. If you get enough tickets you might even unlock a prize which goes into your collection of clothes, shoes, hats, and accessories. The collection delivers some interesting clothing/accessory items, and some of the accessories even have special abilities--for example the radar gun zaps you up into a UFO and drops you off onto a different part of the carnival grounds.

And I liked that each Chapter gets increasingly harder as you advance through the game. I also like that the game gives you extra goals to reach such as awards for finding all the items in all locations, reaching a certain score in the mini games, etc...<br /><br />I didn't like that it was so repetitive with the objects that you seek out.

There doesn't seem to be as much of a variety of objects as in Millionheir.<br /><br />The graphics really bothered me. They were blurry and some images were really hard to make out. Although after you get used to the locations, your eyes tend to adjust. The graphics on Mystery PI for PC are a lot better and I kind of wish I had bought it for PC instead (it was the same amount of money).<br /><br />It didn't really bother me so much that I was confined to the same locations throughout the whole 20 Chapters.

I was hoping for similar entertainment to Cooking Mama, and I did indeed get the same game concept out of this game, just not near the same enjoyment...or any enjoyment...at all.<br /><br />In Iron Chef you can compete on a career level or quick challenges. You start by selecting your competition (based on difficulty) and then a secret ingredient (in the career mode the secret ingredient is selected for you). Next you create your menu by choosing which dishes you're going to do. Then the challenge begins and you're off performing various cooking tasks such as chopping, grinding, frying, etc...to compose your dishes.<br /><br />Now, how is this different from Cooking Mama you say? Well, first off, while in the challenge you have no indication whatsoever of what dish you're on. All tasks for each dish are thrown at you in one long sequence. So once you're done chopping onion, you go on to chop more onion, and you may do that two or three times before you get a different task.<br /><br />Also, the dishes are all the same no matter which secret ingredient you do. I had assumed that each secret ingredient would introduce new dishes, but nope, the dishes are mostly repeated from previous challenges, and they just incorporate the new secret ingredient. For example, in the venison challenge you'll have \"venison hamburgers\" whereas in the boar challenge you'll have \"boar hamburgers\". Same dish, same tasks, different secret ingredient. The game almost seems deceiving stating that there are hundreds of dish variations, but in all actuality the dishes are repeated and it's up to the player to choose which dishes to put on their menu. Within the first three theme ingredients you will have already made the majority of the dishes that the game has to offer.<br /><br />One thing that drove me crazy about this game was that the movements that you make with your stylus to perform the tasks is never consistent. You could slice perfectly in one task, and do it EXACTLY the same way in the next slicing task and the game tells you you've failed. It's either not calibrated right or the game just randomly selects your achievement of performance. I think it's most likely the prior.<br /><br />The game does offer goals for which you can earn awards and medals for various achievements, such as performing 50 boiling tasks, or beating the top three career chefs.

In the day spa you work everyday until all customers have been served. You take the time to diagnose their pet's problems, then care for them based on that. There are different controls and methods you use for each different problem. The overall concept was appealing, but for me it was just way too repetitive. After awhile I found myself rushing through it hoping that something new would arise--however, except for a few minor additions of spa tools over several days of work there really wasn't much of a direction change in the game at all.<br /><br />As far as caring for the apartment you can change the type of furniture and decor (wallpaper, carpet) of the apartment, but you can't add or move items. I had a hard time figuring out what I needed to do to increase my game completion, since I hoped that would make the game more challenging.

Therefore, I didn't get my hopes up for this game but still opted to buy it used to give it a shot.<br /><br />I am a PC Sim gamer, but I also thouroughly enjoy Sims platform games for the goal-oriented aspect. As you probably already know in this platform Sims version you create a character who becomes a crewmember aboard a ship that sinks. Your character is then washed ashore a deserted island and left to fend for him/herself. You start off with simple tasks of learning how to meet the sim's basic needs and gathering resources/food and exploring the island. As tasks are completed more goals are introduced that are increasingly more difficult and time consuming, yet equally intriguing. You gradually discover your other crewmates who, once you convince them to join your \"tribe\", you are able to control as you do your own sim. This is a perk for two reasons: you can use them to gather resources (depending on the job you select for them) while you're working on a goal your own sim; and if your original sim's meters are low you can switch to another and continue with whatever goal you're working on while your other sims are replenishing their meters.<br /><br />I was not bothered at all about meeting the sims basic needs. It did get tiring having to rest my sims, especially when she would refuse to gather resources if she was tired. The sleep meter seemed to run down quite fast. But less than halfway through the game I'd met another Sim and was able to switch back and forth between the two which made it easier to play continuously without having to constantly replenish the needs.<br /><br />I wish the game had done a little more with the recipe factor. There were so many different types of fish, fruit, veggies, and grains but little emphasis on the recipes themselves. I also felt there were WAAAY too many clothing designs and not enough time or desire to make them all. Essentially, my sims wore the same thing the whole way through the game.<br /><br />I enjoyed the graphics of the game, although the perception got a little tricky. It is pretty difficult to adjust your view in the jungle in order to see anything but a bunch of shrubbery on your screen.<br /><br />The one thing the game did not provide was closure. You can get off the island using 3 different methods, but once you've achieved that it just sends you right back to the island to continue meeting goals, making shelters, etc... I know that this the developer's way of allowing freeplay but once I'd met all the goals and discovered all the ways off the island I had no desire to continue playing.<br /><br />All in all, if you like Sims, and you're willing to spend about $15 to buy this game used, then go for it.

Had this been a different character with a different name my disappointment in this game would have been much less--but having a history full of fond memories of the Donkey Kong series I hate to say that this one certainly does not live up to the name. It is very obvious that DK: Jungle Climber was not made by RARE. There is no real adventure incorporated into the game. The concept is new and enticing--Donkey Kong spins on pegs...wooden pegs...stone pegs...iron pegs...ice pegs--they change from level to level. And DK has some interesting new techniques with this game, such as the attack method, and his ability to fly. However, those (and the graphics) are the only perks to the game. The story is average at best. There are very few extras outside the levels, and achieving 100% completion is not worth the time spent. There is a maximum of one bonus barrel in each level (if any at all) and the challenge is always the same--catch bananas in a barrel, whoopee. There are items to collect within the levels, such as the KONG letters, the banana coins, and the DK coin, but they serve no significant purpose other than free men and useless cheats. And don't be fooled by the cover, you cannot play Diddy as you have been able to in past games. If the level manages to actually have a DK barrel, Diddy comes out and sits on DK's back. When DK gets hit, Diddy goes away. My biggest complaint is that I felt that some of the levels were entirely too difficult. Not difficult because of lack of skill, but simply because it would take several times of playing a certain part of the level over and over and over until you figured out the strategy needed to beat it (since DK dies so easily), and by that time you are so tired of the playing the level you're ready to just put the game down for good. I remember spending about 40 men trying to beat one level (and having any more than 20 men is a major feat!)<br /><br />Overall, I'd have to say if you've been embedded in the DK games of the past, don't expect the same level of activity and fun with this one.

And if I had bought it for myself, I would STILL have no complaints. I'm 28 years old and I've been playing The Legends of Zelda since before I can remember. This particular version has been one of the most enjoyable both graphically and conceptually.<br /><br />The one TLOZ I never really got into was on the Game Cube (because I never bothered to buy a GC), but I remember my brother playing it on his and the graphic design of this version and that one seem very similar (anime). Back then I thought it was disappointing, having obsessed over the TLOZs on N64. But in this case, the graphic design of the Phantom Hourglass for DS has not delivered any disappointment by far. I enjoy the cartoonish design of the characters, places, and objects. And it's certainly a satisfaction to not have to worry about the DS freezing up because of having to process a game that it can't handle.<br /><br />As usual, this game follows a storyline involving Link and Zelda. And as usual, Link's purpose it to rescue Zelda from a dark lord. And to do this, as usual, you visit many different lands, interact with many different characters, visit many different temples to destroy their boss, and have lots of secrets to uncover and objects/weapons to obtain. But regardless of the \"usual\" it is still engaging and hard to put down. Maybe it's just me, but I just simply have not tired of the Link and Zelda saga.<br /><br />My favorite feature of this version of TLOZ on DS is the fact that you can use your weapons with your stylus in the most effective way--and I mean, you can LITERALLY draw a path for your boomerang, your Bombchus, etc...and have them travel to parts of the screen that haven't been reachable in previous games. This makes defeating enemies much more exciting, as well as useful in the sense that while your weapon is doing it's thing, you can continue doing your thing. This feature gives the game more room for action, IMHO. The stylus also allows for you to make personal notes on maps and other menus which plays a HUGE role in solving many of the games' mysteries.<br /><br />The only complaints (BEWARE OF SPOILERS IN THIS SECTION) I would really have about the game is that it can take a while to get used to using the stylus to control Link's movement as well as your weapons, especially the sword. But with practice and exposure, difficulty decreases. I would also prefer to not have to spend so much time on the sea traveling from island to island.

There are barriers that keep you from moving on until you've completed certain tasks, so the game is paced, but it does take some buildup of skill and knowledge of the game to figure out what to do next.<br /><br />It does get a little monotonous collecting all of the items to completely finish the game. You can actually \"win\" and find a way off the island pretty easily and early on, but when I reached that point I had only found 45% of what existed on the island.<br /><br />The layout is very different from previous games, almost set in a side-scrolling fashion, but there are features that eliminate tedious tasks. For example,a map selection screen that lets you select your location and land there automatically so that you don't have to walk from location to location--it's a nice feature, you'll see. ;)<br /><br />The graphics honestly aren't much better than previous games, and my hands get a little tired from having to hold the stylus, prop up the console, and manage the control  pad to move the screen back and forth (not necessary, but it's a nice option), but it definitely has me just as addicted as the last several Sims games.", "ParentASIN": "B001EYUO4S", "Timestamp": 1198682336000, "ItemName": "The Sims 2: Castaway - PlayStation 2", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.6, "RatingCount": 288, "Price": 39.28, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation 2", "Games"], "Description": "In \"Stay Alive!\", help your Sim meet basic needs for survival while exploring diverse islands featuring beaches, caves, and jungles.

so...one feature i would die for would be an automatic assignment key that would put a certain number of benches and trash cans and such to paths; bathrooms/kiosks to blocks; and automatically assign your staff to areas. i know this takes away from the purpose of the game, but seriously, it gets to repetitive and mind-numbing, is it entirely necessary for it to be so manual!? a feature like this would give me more time (and desire) to make my park pretty by using the themes and scenery, which i really like to do the most<br />-maybe i'm mistaken but i though on RCT1 you could raise land w/o it going flat, and you could build paths through uneven land w/o having to level it up or down. did they take that feature out? if not, it would certainly be a pleasant addition<br />i guess i play this game to suppress my desires to go to a real theme park (my local isn't open year round), i want the game to be more realistic. when it lacks details like guests walking together (i mean, who goes to an amusement park alone, come on!) or game booths, or snow in Alpine Adventures instead of rain, etc...i get a little frustrated. but i'm a simple person w/a simple mind and i enjoy simple games like this one. it well deserves its four stars.", "ParentASIN": "B0000695GX", "Timestamp": 1072730843000, "ItemName": "RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 - PC", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.4, "RatingCount": 474, "Price": null, "Categories": ["Video Games", "PC", "Games"], "Description": "Create and manage your own amusement park by either setting up a preexisting one or building from scratch.

Overall if this was a stand alone game the player didn't know anything about ff7 then it is a 10/10.  Quality levels (except for the sewer), details, graphic, no bugs.<br /><br />Goods:<br />+production quality: detail, levels, graphic ,render, etc.<br />+no bugs, I didn't notice anything<br />+improved fighting mechanic.  ff7 was turn base old school, ff13 was bad, just boring.  I prefer dragon age party rpg, this is getting better  for jrpg, more realtime.  Still have the classic spells, materina, attacks.  I don't know what changed, since it has been so long ago.<br /><br />+ animation is good and plenty compare to bloodborne where you are clueless most of the time.<br />+ level design again, but it has element you get uncharted, had soem platforming, they upgraded to modern game play style so it wasn't just a graphic facelift.<br />+ Characters interaction is improved and well developed.<br />+ expanded on Midgar quite a bit, so a lot of new things for all of us.<br />+ some new characters are added they are just minor and side quests.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />* I though Neilbeum flash back was a huge driving force int he orginal game, none of that.  Maybe a few Tifa's scene at the area.<br />* side quests are ok, extend the game length.<br />* ending of this game i don't even remembered in the original.<br />* Aeris's (that is how the OG spelled her in the US in 1997) storyline still makes me sad, maybe I know what is go to happened, but still.  Her story is still the sadest gaming moment for me.  Resident evil dogs jumping out the window back in 1996 was the scariest.<br /><br />Bads:<br />- only Midgar<br />- can't play red 13, this is lame.  Get him late and he just flows you.<br />- again this was like only 10-20 of the first game.  If they remake every scene it would take like 4-6 games.  You explored<br />- I guess ff7 was linear, some of the early levels were very linear like ff13 rail running style.<br />- we know sephiroth is a psychopath but they made cloud seem more like a sociopath then I remembered.<br />Overall I thing it is a great game except the this is a many chapters/ #game no trilogy or something.  It makes me missed the other characters and FF7 world that was unique and charm at the time.  People that are giving low reviews are just wants attentions, ignore them.  I played the original day 1, it is made for everybody new and old and for modern times.

The 4k up-scaling looks a tad better tho.  Or maybe my tv screen is bigger now and I can see more.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />- No 4K BLU-RAY.  Why I never planned on upgrading until that gamestop manager misquoted.  Why make a 4K gaming device and skip out one of the big 4k aspect.  If people are cheap stick with the regular PS4 slim.  We who upgrade at least want a basic 4k media format.<br />- It has HDR, but if you have a PS VR it doesn't pass HDR.  No HDR if you have a PS VR.  not like that is quick to detach either.

I think it is a little grainy and colors are different then my TV.<br />3. You can wear your glasses without too much problem.  Ambit if you have gigantic pair of glasses maybe not, I do wear my glasses with this headset.<br /><br />What you need:<br />1. you need a PS4 camera so that is why you get the bundle, simple won't work without it. But I already had one, so I might have to sell my extra.<br />2. The ps4 move on some games, might be the same one on the PS3.  Most of the demos use the PS4 dual shock controller, which everybody has.  Some demo offer either options.  I do know Batman VR the only full game out right now needs the PS Move controllers.<br />3.  Lots of space and more cables (it all comes with them in the bundle).  So it takes a hdmi from the PS4 to some external device (called processor unit).  This external device splits it to the TV and another out to the PS VR.  I noticed the PS Move use different usb cable the regular fat one for charging, not the slim head usb.  More usb cable sizes to manage.  You lose a USB port on the PS4 which needs to be connect to the external device.  I will have to get the VR charging station with all these devices floating around.<br /><br />Not compatible with:<br />1. most headphones/set.  Your 3d party headphone attached to the ps4 DS controller is turned off.  Then I plug my 3rd part senhenniser headset with a mic into the VR input, didn't work wither.  If you have the PS4 gold headset it won't work.  This is ridiculous.  I just got it and now they want me to get the platinum?  The only headphone that worked I got is the free earbud that came with it, so called surround sound.  The mic is built into the VR headset.  Otherwise sound still come out of your stereo system/ receiver.  I do need to play withthe setting, as I was using a nicer headset at bestbuy.<br />2. 3D movies.  The VR world looks 3D, so I put one of my 3d movies and it didn't work, just 2d.  I guess it is different technology.  Too bad it didn't do 3d movies.<br /><br />Issues:<br />1. VR sickness is real.  I felt a hot flash over my body, body was burping and then I threw up in my mouth and had to run the toilet.  The only way to fixed this is not with this system, you need to make the body feel it is moving too.  I am the type that gets dizzy from FPS so I don't play those so other might not have as bad experiences.<br />2.  While playing regular game (not VR) the screen shifted.  Very annoying during dragon age, had to reset the screen setup.<br />3. 1080 isn't the greatest resolution, You can tell the detail isn't great on some item, but for most thing it is fine.  Wished it was 4k.<br />4. I customized my tv so I smooth things out and  the image are as contrasty and saturated, the VR is grainy and saturated, contrast for movies, but that is personal preference.<br /><br />Overall it is a unique experience that I am leaning toward keeping.  I will have to avoid the FPS or fast action game.  Play with slower platform type games.  Use it as a movie theater experiences.  Comes with 2 demo discs.

Listen to surround sound, wireless with chat.  also note you have this headset be charging as you play (like the controller) but you would need a long usb mini cable.<br />2. if you run out of batter, just plug the 2.5 audio line to the headphone to ps4 controller.<br />3. can be used on a computer or any phone, mp3 player with the audio line 2.5.<br />4. can be use on the computer via the usb dongle.

There isn't any extra gameplay for this version.  No real artwork or special case. You get like a low level dragon armor and swords which str useless after you play awhile.  You get a weird looking mount/horse.  I don't use the horse much.  A pointy throne is new, who cares.  It said I get some game songs, where?<br />------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Otherwise this is a great game for DA fans and I gave it a 5 stars in the regular version.<br /><br />Update:<br />I just finished the game at 110 hrs and did almost all the side tasks (I am missing 5 shards and I can do that within a hour if I wanted too). I usually don't do the main storyline until I have nothing to do with the all the other tasks/ map completed (that how I played all other DA, do everything). I beat my first dragon at level 12-14ish in Ferelden (that is early in the game or first half) to see how that goes (took awhile). But I finished all my dragons on 1 run at level 20, as I realized I wasn't leveling as fast anymore unless I beat higher level enemies. I finished at level 24-1/2. Meaning, I didn't have much issues with the final boss. I still think DA:O was still the best in term of storyline, characters, and the quirky charms. This game beat it out in overall length, detail and size, but not the other stuffs I mentioned. As an older gamer this game is a huge investment in time/ and my life. I can't replay games as when i was younger, but I am walking away this game very happy. This was my first game I bought in 2014 and for the PS4. I get free small games on PSN plus.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I was going to write a review after 20hrs and give it a 4 stars. Now into 80+ hrs and at level 20 I changed my stance to a 5 stars. I think the first DA origin/ awakening is still the best in the series overall (10/10). The second dragon age had simpler combat, with cookie cutter levels that were short (8/10). They reused so many levels/layouts in DA2 it was joke, trying to make it seem longer. Well DA:Inq is really big. I still have one big map left and hopefully it trigger more areas. I will try not give off too many spoilers, so I will try to be vague in some description, and talk more of the mechanic of the game.  I think the early part was a little rough, for people that are looking for more action/integrate and just quit.  Some people like shock value, DA:O had a lots of shock values, you don't get it as much here.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. Good size map. Some map or area can take a day to finish (normal people playing less then 8hr). Hinterland map is gigantic and after a while you get tired of it.<br />2. Unique worlds. I still remembered doing the same dungeons, castle over and over in different part of the map in DA2. This game is beautiful and different. I rarely go to an area more than 2x too much to explore. The full moon in the desert, waterfall in the canyon oasis, and France like forest (green marsh) are some of the best maps. The France or Italian -like Incognito ball party at a chateau was very nice too.<br />3. Storyline is a continuation of DA:O and DA2, so if you played with those game you see characters that were minor before are now part of the new storyline. Also you must login onto EA's dragon keep to update your character logs from the previous 2 games if you want those storyline events to be noticed in this game. I didn't do it that before starting this game, wished I did, but I don't think it matter too much really.<br />4. Great graphic on the PS4. Further draw distance, the previous games even if you see the world open. You kind of know you are boxed in, not this game. The environment is very large and you can see further if you stand on a hill top. Character details are better, so is the environment. Level map are bigger, in the other 2 games, you have to reload scenes way too much, not here.<br />5. Background/ ambient music is good (not all areas), much better than DA2, but I like DAO for some reason. Like the charm of Origin.<br />6. Dragons, and lots of them. They are a certain levels so you might have to skip them the first time around and come back when you are strong enough.<br />7. Puzzles here and there is nice. I did almost all of the puzzles myself. Did the constellation without much issues (1 or 2 were hard but most are easy).<br /><br />Differences:<br />1. Combat, while it is still dragon age in general. It took some use to, the button layout and tactic changed a little. Actually it was hard early on as your character is weak and enemies have curtain level to them. No constant healer. Mages in other games I use as healer for the group. Mages are used as ranger fighter or barrier user here and to open magic doors. They have lifewind and that is you time it right you can resurrect a player. Only 1 of the 3 mages has a true healing spell and that is Vivanne. She annoyed me at first, but I realized I need her healing, which takes time to regen anyways. You get only 8 heal potions too (upgrade to 12 by inquisitor perks) so you will die a lot in this game and I was on causal. As usual always carry a mage and rogue to open certain area. Iron Bull's lines are hilarious, DA's Qunari are very monotone and boring, but they broke the rules for Iron Bull.<br />1b. You need to carry a rogue and mage with you all the time as they can open certain doors or situations. Vivienne is the best mage, Cassandra's skill can turn on guard for all team member (Templar's skill tree). Varric and the Sera are equal archers, so I switch between them for Dragon fights. Otherwise I switch between all the character for regular exploration as I said before. For melee players you need to get item that increase guard. My main character with guard on didn't really die in the Dragon fights, as the other members are dying over and over.<br />2. Crafting, upgrade, and potions making. If you want good weapons and armors you can actually craft better one yourself. In other games, you get better weapons and armors as you play, oddly the not the case here. Still using some of the best weapons I found in the middle of the game. Maybe I am playing some of the harder levels first and the easy one later, maybe.<br />3. War-room, where you plan your next attack and world strategies. Didn't like it at first, but it is very cool.<br />4. Some annoying characters and some good companion characters. I dove have a fav 4 for major battles. But for most exploration, I mixed all the characters to see what they can do. Also when you mixed them, they have more dialogues and argument.<br />5. I rather fight darkspawns then fighting other humans for some reason. You fight a lot of humans here.<br /><br />Bads:<br />1. In some game play: if you don't map some command action/skills to your controller you can't use them. In previous game the radio/radius control allow you to get to command skills not mapped so you can use it during combat.<br />2. Map or gps is hard to use at time. I been climbing cliff and scaling mountain that are unclimbable when it look like it is doable but isn't. Cartoon map are hard to tell what is a what elevation also. Just a little frustrating on the map part, but the world is very true 3d and very platform-ish then flat.<br />3. I got the deluxe edition hoping to get more scenes or something good, it is a waste of money.<br />4. no treasure/item chest. I am guess they make you pay for it like in the first game dlc later, very cheap.<br />5. Less buggy, but some are there. The 2 other DA games were extremely buggy. You have to save often because some tasks don't work and you have to reload and it might fix the freeze or some other bugs. Haven't felt bugs were an issue here, I do have issues with the radius control at times. But leaving the map or recharging my controllers seem to help. I played DAO may times, BioWare usually send patches later to fix things.<br /><br />This is becoming a better game as I play, storyline is good, environments are enjoyable to explore. It is different in the game play mechanic a little, but still stays true to the Dragon Age series. This is a real game compared to DA2, which now looks like an add-on to DAO. Still remembered so many scenes, level and moments from DAO, but not much of DA2.

I owned all the Playstation (1-4) systems, and no reason not to get this one.  I guess by now I am less of a gamer as I use too, and bought it for the tech and home theater unit.  Unlike the previous 3 systems, this system doesn't replace its predecessor.  I think I played old games on a new system the previous 3 times, but not his one.  This is the first system I didn't buy a single game for at launch.  I don't like shooter nor the same sport and racing games 3rd party throw at you.  I think for the ps3 launch all I had was the movie Talladega Nights and ridge racer 7.<br /><br />Games:<br />Humm i don't game as much, and only bought 3 boxed games (not digital download) for the PS3 last year (2 I didn't even get past 1/4 of the game).  The only game I am interested in is Dragon Age3 and the Witcher3.  I bought every Resident Evil, but might skip the next one since it isn't a survival horror anymore, more of a shooter.  Since I got PSN plus I got 2 free games to download, they are ok (always hungry and resogun).  The bad things is I have a few digital download small games for PS3 and they don't show up or are compatible with the ps4 yet.  This is the most ungamely crossover I ever had.<br /><br />Interface:<br />Is fine I don't get too carry, thought the xmb was fine.  Don't see as much customizable settings as in the PS3.  It is more web feed ordinate.  You see what your friends played and watch, useless new feed and people uploading video of themselves.  The web browser is much improved over the PS3.  It is on the same level of andriod or better.  Just can't see adobe flash video.<br /><br />Tech hardware:<br />I want the camera, and it isn't even in stock anywhere, except for the few people who upload video of themselves on the video section.  Controller is a little different and better to hold.  It doesn't feel as cheap plastic as it used too, got some grip, the handles are a little slimmer.  The touch pad is good for watching app like netflix.  The controller has a cool light, but no where to disable it in the setting.  Didn't see where the eject and power button was, so I just press any recessed buttons and found that  out.  I like the glowing blue light on the console, very modern.  My old ps3 bluetooth might and remote will not work, haven't found a way to sync them.  But the controller comes with an earpiece and mic.<br /><br />Apps/ features:<br />DLNA is gone, this is applauding, you don't take features away that was there in the old system.  DLNA is good that I can see photos, video, music on my home server or other computer on the PS3.  Sony is one of the biggest backer of DLNA a few years ago.  They are just trying to push their paid video and music service.  Well I complained and I and many other complained and they said they will bring it back in a later firmware update, and they better.<br />Netflic and Amazon prime is still there, but no youtube, they got some music video channel which i sgood, but doesn't have all the video that youtube has.  Since the web browser can't support flash, can't watch youtube there either.<br /><br />All in all<br />I know the games will come and I am not much of a gamer anymore.  I think the tech is very nice and priced reasonably.  I really hope they update the psn games for th eps3 for the ps4 and add dlna so I can retired my PS3 which at this point I can't.

I haven't played any other FF games except for FFVII.  I put 6-8 hr into game and wished I could return it and wait till the price drop to 30-40 bucks, since it is not a great game at all.<br /><br />Gameplay, exploration, battle strategies.<br /><br />What this game is sorely lacking is game play, exploration and battle strategies.  The game play is linear it is like they are trying to push you through the game and you can't really go back and explore, once you finish a chapter you are done, there is no world map to go back and forth from.  The old FF7 is 3rd person perspective or overview where you can explore more.  This game is wonderfully design but the level is also linear in design and gameplay.  You basically running through a tunnel, bridge or a valley most of the game, once in a while you stop and look around.  The third person perspective is behind the back like Dragon Age but with tunnel vision.  Battle mechanic is changed for the worst, haven't play X, XII.., but in 7 you are able to control all characters in a turn base.  Here you control one person the other just do whatever they want.  Square added this paradigm shift which is a joke, where other can be a medic, commando, whatever.  Back then (FF7) you don't need this since any characters can block, heal, attack, cast spell, revival, summon etc.  They have simplified the battle mechanic to be so simple that you just hit the \"X\" button, kind of like Heavy Rain, but not as fun.  The rpg element isn't that deep or advance in this series.  Even Diablo copied FF7 to add orb or mana into weapon, there is none here.  You don't really pick much items in this game either.<br /><br />Graphic/ mechanic<br /><br />At first, I couldn't believe it looks so good at 1080p on my LCD.  It just claims the best looking console game over Heavy Rain.  The environment is great looking, detail and deep.  The lack of interaction is quite sad.  You walk up to it and press \"x\", could of use some RE interaction/ physic, but it is a FF game.  There is no frame rate drop at all.  I guess the 360 version is compressed, but there is none here.  The game load quite fast compare to Dragon Age.  There are cut-scenes like every third battle, I am guessing they are loading the environment in the background.  This game shockingly have little load screen and didn't install any file on my PS3(not taking about save file just install file).<br /><br />Story<br /><br />So far the bread and butter of FF series, the story, just isn't that great in this game.  I really don't care for the characters too much.  Some are annoying, other are punks.  Most of the characters are like teenagers or younger dealing with world issues.  There is sense of FF7 soldier bad government in the plot.  The music and soundtrack just isn't that magical either.<br /><br />FF7 was so good that it left a lasting impression in my mind that after all these years to play FF again, I felt it fail quite miserably.  As a rpg it fail to have depth like today games: Dragon Age or even Sacred II.  The linear storyline is similar to Heavy Rain, but is just not that engaging or tense.

Well it is still awesome, but I was hoping a little more of something.  If you like the Tekken fighting controls, it is still there, and it is still tight.  They actually force you to play the Scenario/story mode which is pretty much Tekken Force in the past.  This is the only way you can unlock characters' ending animations.  Also another way of getting free custom upgrades.  Arcade mode is open to all characters and so is the online match.  As always the female characters are easy to pick up since they are so quick.  The big wrestlers are so slow and the power damages are about the same with the quicker characters, so there is a little unbalance there.<br /><br />Performance:<br />The characters are very impressive, but the anti-aliasing jaggy edge is there.  This is one reason I knocked a star off.  Soul Caliber 4 was the smoothest looking models and characters I have seen and it came out a year before this and I also got that on the PS3. (Oddly when I turn off the motion blur option it were less jaggedness, but less cool effects)  The only thing I notice, the difference between the two is the background in Tekken 6 is more dynamic.  Things break apart, more animation in the background.  The snow, fog, sunlight and other environmental effects/ physic are cooler, compare to the plain and smooth SC4.  I haven't notice any major glitches at all.  The fighting is till fast.<br /><br />Online:<br />The waiting is a tag longer compare to SC4, but I think they load everything more so I haven't experience any freezing, lagging or glitches like I did for SC4.  So basically it is a better has an online performance when you are actually fighting.<br /><br />Characters<br />I usually stick to Jin style, which Lars is a strong punching character too.  I have got a hang of Bob yet, kind of power of a faster Panda and quick leg combos.  Zafina is a like a hybrid of voldo and Anna W a little off balance style.  Haven't touch Miguel or Leo that much yet.  You can customized your characters by buying items and from the scenario mode (Tekken force), but you can't build a characters ground up like in SC4 which I thought was lacking.<br /><br />Overall for Tekken fan this is a worthy buy and shows enough special effects in the graphic department over Tekken 5.  The Tekken force controls and mode is much better this time around and is intergraded into the gameplay if you want to unlock something.

I still think the original RE1 was my favorite then follow by the huge RE4.  This series has changed over the time.  I felt compel to write this base on a bias review from a 360 fan boy, who said the PS3 version has lag, it doesn't, or if you have cheap computer hardware, maybe.  I have a new d-link n router with QoS, but I do a hard-wire to the PS3, grant I got the 20 GB version.  I play 75% of the time on on-line co-op and think it is a fresh experience to the game.  This game looks and has the same feels and hue of Metal Gear Solid 4 in the early round; the yellowish desert town in the beginning.  I think the graphic is much better than MGS4.<br /><br />What new:<br />Well the online co-op is the main thing.  I am not sure which of the two character, Chris or Sheva the other person actually plays.  People usually join my game for a chapter or so and they are Sheva.  Maybe I am Sheva to them? (updated they are Sheva)  This game moves very fast with online play.  I don't sense the weapons differentiate themselves as much as they used to.  A pistol was useless in the late round of the previous game, but is still useful here.  Curtain weapons were used on curtain enemy in RE4, most weapons here can be used on anybody, just the firepower level in RE5.<br />Camera is improved from RE4.  As a person who gets dizzy from quick FPS game with the jerky camera, RE5 is much smoother than 4.  You use both analog stick here.  The L analog is the move and the right analog is turning your head.  With some combos, you can do a quick turn and the camera moves much better.  I couldn't play RE4 for more than 2 hours.  I did 6 hours last night on 5, with less dizziness.<br />There is a gunner chapter of the game which is a little tough, but is much easier with co-op.  Actually the is game is easier with co-op play.<br /><br />What is different:<br />Well it is not a survival horror anymore, just not scary at all.  There was a little in RE4, but the formula has been removed.  This is all action and the puzzles are weak, just a few keys to open a few door.  I do like the RE1 to 3 Code Veroncia because of the puzzle.  The in-game item chest is gone, but you can collect items and dump them between chapters in the inventory menu.  Game load fairly quick on the PS3 version.  Split screens in mercenaries mode with a friend is ok, the screens is split into two screens horitzonally and get smaller too.<br /><br />Overall I give this a 9.4 out of 10.  It is fun and worth the wait, but it isn't my favorite RE series game yet.  If you are an RE5 fan there is no reason to past this one at all.  The game is a lot shorter then RE4.

Your weapons are the same, only the characters will level up.  Game mode is altered a little with online play.  The usual story line, verse, arcade modes are back.  The storyline matches are a little different.  You face 2-3 enemies per round with one life bar, sound hard, but it is actually easy in normal mode.  There are only 5 rounds.  The ending clips aren't that great either.<br /><br />The extra and characters creation is also tweaked a little.  You can't really randomly create really odd characters like before, more like modifying existing one.  I am not sure if all the ending movies can be viewed like before in a theater mode, I didn't find it.  The character bio is really lame this time.  You get like an artwork with the written description, gone is the 3d model that you can rotate and zoom in Soul Caliber III.  Those weird odd mini game and quests are gone from SC3.  There is a tower game, but that is just like a regular arcade version.  No more buying weapons for your character development.  Why are half the scenes from SC3, with better detail?  A lot more female characters are a great plus, Ivy and some of the ladies are quite Taki-ness.<br /><br />The team spent a lot of time on the animation, design and rendering of the characters, and kind of chopped skipped on the extra features that were found in SC3.

First of all, the game was announced and explained by the developers MULTIPLE TIMES that this was going to be a multiple release game meaning it is being split into parts. If you failed to pay attention that when it was stated AGES ago that this was going to happen, that's your own fault. Secondly, so say you are getting 10 or 15 percent of what FF7 original was is also false....this first installation of the Remake expands upon Midgar, the opening city of the original FF7. They took what takes AT MOST 3 hours in the original game and expands it past 30 hours. It fleshes out a ton of unknown backstory for many of the beginning characters that we did not receive in the original game. And lastly, if you are seriously offended by the cursing in this game that is rated T for Teen, you seriously have to do more research with the ESRB....the original game had cursing in it all the way back in 1997. And now with all of the stuff cleared up, I gave the game a 4 instead of a 5 because while the game is honestly very good, it does have some slight issues that keep it from being perfect. I own a ps4 pro and a ps4 slim and there is most certainly a difference in visual fidelity. It's not a huge deal but there is definitely an issue with some of the textures causing an almost muddy image on objects such as doors as walls. It isn't a game breaker and can probably be patched but it's worth saying. Lastly, while the side quests and such were a great addition for a little bit more content and expanding upon Midgar, some of it was a little unnecessary and felt almost shoe horned in to make the game longer when it wasn't particularly needed. Overall, the game looks and plays amazing. It's effort to entice both original fans like myself and newcomers is clear and understood. While I wish that the entire game was being released at once rather than in parts, I am eagerly looking forward to part 2 and I paid attention ages ago when they stated that part 2 is in development.

{"UserID": "AHAOAIYS3GTCFSVCHOHANFHEVJGA", "ReviewList": [{"Rating": 5.0, "Title": "Fantastic!", "Content": "Spectacular. Superb graphics, fun challenging combat, and some new story twists that are unexpected. It's almost like a whole story from the original. Same core story of course, but so far there have been some nice additions and twists to it. I will say I miss the old school style combat. There is a classic mode combat option, but its not really classic like you'd think, and it defaults to easy difficulty which could make playing it in classic mode kind of dull. So far the levels/areas are pretty linear. It could open up later, but in the original Midgar was a very linear part of game. You can only use magic/items, like healing, in the field. And you must cycle thru charcters to see their health and heal them. I dislike this. I would rather go to the menu to see everyones health/staus all together and heal as needed. The summons are disappointing in the fact that you cannot summon as you please like in the original. It reminds me of FF15 where certain conditions must be meet. It says something about it has to be a certain type of battle or enemy your facing. Ive had a summon materia for awhile and still not been able to use it or had a fight that triggered the option for it. So stinking lame to make it play that way.

Everything included is quailty and worth the extra price. The game itself is spectacular. Superb graphics, fun challenging combat, and some new story twists that are unexpected. It's almost like a whole story from the original. Same core story of course, but so far there have been some nice additions and twists to it. I will say I miss the old school style combat. There is a classic mode combat option, but its not really classic like you'd think, and it defaults to easy difficulty which could make playing it in classic mode kind of dull. So far the levels/areas are pretty linear. It could open up later, but in the original Midgar was a very linear part of game. You can only use magic/items, like healing, in the field. And you must cycle thru charcters to see their health and heal them. I dislike this. I would rather go to the menu to see everyones health/staus all together and heal as needed. The summons are disappointing in the fact that you cannot summon as you please like in the original. It reminds me of FF15 where certain conditions must be meet. It says something about it has to be a certain type of battle or enemy your facing. Ive had a summon materia for awhile and still not been able to use it or had a fight that triggered the option for it. So stinking lame to make it play that way.

Unique and unlike anything I've played!", "Content": "This is my first Metro game and I gotta say Im really enjoying the whole experience. The controls are well done and combat is fun, engaging, and challenging. Some strategy is required due to limited resources and ammo. Graphics are very nice. I find myself stopping often just to take in the marvelous view. There's also a photo mode. The story is well told and exciting and compelling. Ive heard you need to play the previous games to know whats going on, but the story is so well done that I don't feel lost at all. I know exactly whats going on, I understand the story, and I know what im supposed to do. I also truly appreciate how the story gives you a sense of purpose and reason why your doing what your doing, and it makes sense. Anyway the story is very good. The game can be quite challenging, and downright hard sometimes, as you are in a survival situation and everything is limited. The world is dangerous so you have to proceed in most places with caution. It can be tough until you get used to the flow of the game. I personally found that the easy setting felt more balanced, and really felt more like a normal difficulty. Normal felt like it shouldve actually been a hard difficulty. On easy it was still not necessary easy. The only difference I really noticed was the game tended to give more resources for crafting essentials and ammo, which you need a lot of. I did not notice any difference in enemy difficulty, they had the same aggression, still took the same amount of shots to kill, maybe the damage they do was slightly reduced, and the crafting still cost the same amount of resources. On normal I was constantly running out of ammo and resources, and always scurrying to try find more becomes exhausting. I typically don't do easy in games but it just felt more balanced to me. And I just had much more fun with it on easy. I can see the appeal for harder difficulties after you've played and learned the game and want a truly difficult challenge. This game will give it you. When exploring you have a map that pulls up in real time and does not pause. You can pause the game if needed. The map will update as you discover things and places. I advise upgrading your gear with the compass asap so you can navigate more easily. You will need to explore to find resources, gear, new weapons and weapon parts so you can modify your weapons and make them stronger. You have to clean them every so often as well or they will degrade causing the damage to reduce. You use the resources you find to craft many different things some of which are ammo, health, and mask filters which you must have when you are in poisonous or radiated environments. You do not gain experience or level up. You get stronger by exploring and discovery. Collect all the resources you can for crafting ammo and other essentials. Ammo can be extremely limited at times. You will find new/stronger weapons and weapon parts to modify/enhance your weapons. You will find new gear and add-ons that enhance your gear, body armor, helmet, etc. The story progresses on a train that takes you thru different open areas and as time progresses the seasons of the year will also change. The whole experience is just compelling and immersive and engaging. I find myself truly compelled to want to keep pressing forward to find out whats next. Overall a really great gaming experience!

I personally like that theres no npc's (or at least none so far) meaning no fowl language dialog, and I can feel comfortable allowing my son to play too. It has some minor bugs but Ive honestly not come across anything game breaking. Its a lot of exploring and looting and some battles inbetween. Gun play and controls are tight and spot on. We really enjoy the exploration and looting and survival aspect. You find clues to progress the story as in letters, recordings, and such that tell the story. There's always this sense that youre right behind the people that have fled and evacuated, and that youre about to discover something big or important. You gain exp and level up. You get skill points to use for skills and abilities. I find the skill progression and finding new weapons to be pretty satisfying like you've really earned something that's important and highly needed. One example is inventory space. As small of a thing as that is I got some real satisfation working toward building up the skill to carry more inventory, especially after struggling for a bit with limited space. And there's plenty of other skills to get as well. You can modify weapons with different ammo types and attachments. Theres a real satisfaction exploring and finding better weapons, ammo, and attachments especially when its more difficult to defeat machines with the dilapidated and worn weapons at the beginning, and then when you find a better condition weapon or attachment and knowing it will help keep you alive just feels really satisfying in this game. The game does a great job with the exploring and looting aspects and giving you just what you need and making you wanna find the next best thing. Also your clothes are equipable and you find new pieces throughout the world. Some have armor like attributes to improve your stats which are related to certain abilities as well. Overall its a good game! Its missing the AAA flashy stuff and other things you would expect in a $60 game but this a lower budget title and it does what its supposed to do very well. You can play completely solo. It feels pretty good as a single player experience and is my personal preference, but its fun to play with a friend. Ive really enjoyed playing it with my son. The only cons really imo are you can't ride the bicycles that seem to be everywhere (that would be an awesome vehicle option) and you have no melee attack which would be helpful when the machines run toward you.

They all say basically the same thing and they are all correct. Except for negatives regarding graphics because the graphics are superb. Im not entirely sure how its getting 5 stars ratings and the high praise from the mainstream review outlets. But anyway the controls are highly frustrating especially on the horse. Youre forced to walk (at a slow snails pace walk) in certain areas and then when you are allowed to run you have to hold or continually tap a button which really sucks because you cant enjoy looking around with the camera. Same with the horse. There are a lot of unnecessary button presses and controls to do basic actions. The controls and movements just feel wrong. They are odd and unnatural and do not allow for a smooth control flow as you would expect in a video game. The story I found to be good and it was enough to keep me going for several hours but I struggled so much with the controls that it really made the game not much fun at all. Also there are so many options and icons and things that look like you should be able to do and I just felt lost because the game doesn't give clear instructions on a lot of it. And for some reason they designed the pop up tutorial messages to occur when events or story stuff is happening on the screen. I missed notifications because of this and probable why I felt lost sometimes on what do. And then I would make sure to read a message and completely miss what the characters were saying. very frustrating. I spent so much time trying to tweak the options to get the controls more user friendly and fun but the options available just don't do it. The best control scheme was Standard FPS which helped with sprinting but why am I forced to walk! Id rather have the default as run and then push/hold a button to walk. If this game had the foot and horse controls of a game like Origins or Odyssey or any other modern recent decent game then this would be a near perfect game. The survival elements are pretty good but can be a bit much in some aspects making it more of a forced chore that is not always fun. Overall not really that great a game.

Its not quite as good as any one of those games alone but there are similarities that remind me of those game types. Combat is different then anything ive ever played. Come close to an enemy and you go into a battle screen. Youre in a fixed position while in battle. You can strafe left/right to circle the battlefield. Use the analog stick to dodge. Use buttons to attack, block, magic and abilities. Its very unusual at first. I was expecting zelda, fable style combat and was ready to quit almost immediately after my first battle.

I beat the first boss and my shield was upgraded with its power and I got a special attack to use in battle. The game is more level oriented but different paths allow exploration. Its becomes kind of addicting exploring levels and earning money and exp to upgrade your character. You follow main story quests and pick up side quests as well. Also you obtain allies and can call on their special attacks when needed. Only complaint is the camera. It auto centers and you can't adjust the distance from the character, both are a bit annoying at first but you get used to it.

It can be frustrating and overly difficult, but you can customize specific combat settings after starting a new game. This makes the combat work more in your favor.

You can adjust combat settings which makes the combat much more enjoyable. Graphics not top tier but really aren't bad at all. The world seems detailed and vibrant and looks pretty good. Character models appear crisp and detailed. Controls seem fairly smooth but sometimes can be a little &#34;clunky&#34;. I was actually surprised at how smooth the camera control is. I believe my expectation was lowered because of bad reviews, but controls dont seem to be a bad issue at all. You can also adjust camera distance from your character. You can jump, climb, sprint, and fly with a jetpack. The jetpack works well and is fun to use to navigate around. Climbing a ladder for some reason is extremely slow but instead I just jetpack up there. You can literally jump/fall from just about anywhere and land safely with the jetpack. Voice/dialog seems to work just fine, but sometimes can sound kinda cheesy. Conversations are engaging and come with choices and consequences. You level up and distribute points to your attributes. You can learn skills/abilities. Equip all kinds of weapons, armor, acc, and use many other items. The only cons are graphics arent top tier but still not bad at all. Combat can feel unbalanced and frustrating if you don't customize your combat settings. Overall the game is good and highly enjoyable. Im glad I didn't fully base my buying decision on negative reviews.

At first this game was a solid 4 star worthy game, but now that I have played a good bit I must say that I am very thoroughly enjoying this game. Definitely 5 stars. The combat takes some getting used and can feel discouraging sometimes early on until you get some experience using it, but as you upgrade you and your teams abilities it becomes quite clear that the combat is well done and extremely fun and satisfying to play. Its fun just to take off in a direction and enjoy exploring and the world is not empty as some reviews suggest. I happened upon a map piece on the porch of a random house while out wandering around in the open world. It started a side quest which other wise appears would not have happened if I had not been exploring and found this. There are all kinds of items and things to be found while exploring off the main path. I came across a huge sleeping bird monster while on a mission I happened to do at night. I was to sneak by it to get what I came for and sneak back thru again. Well I decided to wait until morning to get a good look at it and this thing was enormous. It and stayed asleep until I tried to sneak back by it and then it awoke. It was incredibly huge and this epic boss type music began playing while it expanded its wings and came toward me and then flew off into the distance. I look forward to battling that thing one day! I find the story good and compelling although it can appear to be slow moving at times, but thats only because of the open world design and the multiple side quests you can do instead of just focusing on the main story missions.

I love stealth and prefer that approach in any game when its available, but this game does not pull it off very well. The enemies are hard to see, they blend right into the background, appears to be the lighting design of the game and there's no option to adjust display or brightness. There is an instinct feature that highlights enemies but its limited and runs out quickly and the enemies do not stay highlighted after its turned off. The player is on auto walk, you must push X to run which is pointless because you could easily run into the hard to see enemies and you cant use the right analog camera while your running which means you cant see exactly see where your running to.

I have been playing it for awhile and I hate it, for various reasons.  First, it's an open world game with no sense of direction that I've found.  Everything is so vague and there's no way you will figure out this game without consulting the internet for QnA and walkthroughs.  One thing I absolutely HATE when trying to play a game.  When I want to play a game, I don't want to have to keep stepping away from the screen to go log on my computer to figure out...  what do I do next?  Where do I go?  How do I make this recipe?<br /><br />For example, in the very beginning, you need to complete 3 trials in 3 shrines.  Well that's all fine and dandy, except the 3rd shrine is located atop a mountain that is cold.  You can't get there without some way to keep yourself warm.  I wandered around this area countless hours until I finally by luck stumbled upon some old diary that said something about making a recipe that keeps you warm.  Who would have known?  You will have no idea until you stumble upon this isolated small shack and find the diary.  But doesn't give you the recipe!!!  You have to figure it out on your own because the stupid old man wrote the diary forgot the final recipe and it's up to you to figure that out.  Yeah good luck with that.  The first ingredient is peppers which you can find and pick.  The 2nd recipe is raw meat.  which takes quite awhile to figure out how to even find.  You have to wander around some more until you find some boars in a forest to kill.  As for the 3rd ingredient, you will be a week putting together all sorts of different combinations to find the 3rd is a fish.  You have no way of figuring this out unless you get on the internet and look it up.<br /><br />I spent hours and hours just wandering around in this game figuring out what I'm supposed to do.  I cannot STAND games like that.  Just wander around until by luck you stumble upon something related to your quest.  At which point, you need to blindly wander around some more.<br /><br />I don't know about the people who wrote the positive reviews, but I have a life.  I have a job, I have a family and a home.  What I DON'T have, is countless hours to wander around doing nothing.  Hours and hours and hours trying to figure out where the shrines are and how to make some stupid recipe that you have to guess on your own.  And this is only the beginning of the game.  I don't even want to think about what it's like in the later levels.<br /><br />Now that that's out of the way, my other complaint is about the weapons.  You have sticks, swords, spears, bows, clubs all sorts  of weapons.  Cool right?  Except they are  all junk.  After you kill a couple of goblins, the weapon breaks.  In the middle of a fight and all of a sudden, your sword has broken!!!  Then you have to fart around the menu to equip another sword.  You swipe it a few times and oops!  It's broke too!  Let's try the club.  Broke!  Equip the spear.  Broke!!!  I'm tired of hoarding swords and spears in my bag because they keep breaking.  And your SOL if they all break.  Yeah you can't fight without a weapon.  Link just looks at his empty hand like he's stupid.  Just ball up your fist and punch the goblin in the face or kick him where it counts.  Nope he just looks at his hand.  So what do you do when you break all your weapons?  You guessed it.  Run away.  Then you have to waaaaaander around blindly until you stumble on an axe or something.  Same with the bows.  They break too.<br /><br />And what happens during a boss fight?  SAME THING.  You dodge his attack and mash him a round then your weapon breaks and he has hardly any damage done at all.  But then you have to go to the menu and equip another weapon.  In the meantime, by the time that's done, hes coming in for a other attack.  Same sequence.  Dodge, attack, weapon breaks, replaced.  But when he hits you ONCE, its game over and you have to continue and sit through the load screen.  Not to mention the music is freaking pathetic and annoying.<br /><br />Weapons breaking, constantly healing after one hit, This is incredibly stupid to have to do when you are in the middle of an intense fight where you need to focus on what your doing rather than mess around swapping out weapons that keep breaking.<br /><br />Forget this.  Going to game stop tomorrow to trade this in.  I don't have time for this kind of garbage. I bought a Nintendo switch just for this game, because I read it was a good game.  Looks like I'm putting the switch away and hooking my PS4 back up and put back in my latest Final Fantasy game, where at least my weapons don't break, I don't die in one hit and I have some sort of sense of direction and what I'm supposed to do.<br /><br />Fing garbage.

Some doors you can go in dont even look like doors so its easy to miss something.  There is no item screen so you have to preset your items for battle continuously as they run out.  This is stupid.

Well the graphics are beautiful, but this isn't exactly a game you would have your 5 year old play.  Oh no, this is some serious stuff!  The game play is extremely difficult, as others have said.  I think the difficulty just adds to the overall gloominess of the game.  All is hopeless.  You're stuck.  How could a game about a dolphin be so depressing you ask?  Well the game starts out with Ecco (the dolphin) swimming around the sea with his family.  The music is lovely and everything is perfect.

His family and friends are gone, the music has changed to some dreadful depressing music that is nothing less than a deep brooding despair.

I was a bit disappointed in this game.  It's more of a side scroller action game rather than an RPG, like the GC version was.  Though the game is good, there were several things that really annoyed me<br /><br />The bad:<br />1. It's good to have some dialogue in a good video game, but Super Paper Mario over does it.  You have cut scenes between cut scenes, with a short cut scene in between that.  All the reading got on my nerves and I found myself just laying back hitting the buttons just to get it over with, without reading what was going on.  Especially in world 7.  The end of world 7 was ridiculous.  \"blah blah blah blah blah blah blah\" I'm thinking when are they going to shut up?  I hated world 7.  It was annoying, long, and didn't even fit the natural line of the game.  world 6 is kinda dark and gloomy.  Dark colors, creepy atmosphere and then all of a sudden you're in world 7 with fluffy clouds, cute little angel like things and god awful background music.  World 7 seemed to drag on and on.  I hated it.  When you finally get through this level, after the tormenting long dialogue, you go to the next Chapter, 8.  Which is also dark, gloomy and black.  World 7 just didn't fit the game at all.  World 8 sucks.  Enemies pop out of nowhere, enemies that are difficult to avoid. Cheap shots, etc.<br /><br />2. GC version, the music was really cool.  Kinda catchy.  Not in this one.  SPM is a bunch of random goofy sounds put together and was rather obnoxious (especially the awful level 7).  Yeah....  didn't like the music. World 2 and 6 weren't bad soundtracks.<br /><br />3. Endless walking and wandering around.  Before you can proceed to the next Chapter of the game, you have to find what is called a \"Heart Pillar\", which can be confusing.  You find yourself walking around town, the outskirts of town, above the town, under the town and everywhere else, trying to find the stupid pillar.  There are no clues as to where the next heart pillar is, so you find yourself wandering around the town of Flipside without any direction.  And it gets worse in the later chapters of the game, because not only do you have the town of Flipside, but you also have Flopside.  And sections of the game called \"Underwhere\" and \"Overthere\" and it turns into this jumbled confusing MESS because all the names and places are so similar so it's very difficult to find your way around, especially since Flopside is a mirror of Flipside.  So be prepared to waste time just roaming around, flipping into 3D and back, falling over edges and everything else trying to find the next part of the game.<br /><br />4.  Controls kinda suck.  I'm not saying the controls are BAD, but it has it's flaws.  There seems to be a slight delay from the time you hit the button to the time you jump.  3D mode can be confusing because it's hard to tell exactly where you are.  For instance, if you are trying to hit a block, it's difficult to tell whether you are under the block or not.  If you have to jump over a pit, it's hard to tell where the pit starts and ends so you end up falling down the hole.<br /><br />5.  It's action.  Not RPG.<br /><br />6.  Too repetitive.  It would have been nice to be able to travel to different towns, meet different people and do some more interesting side quests.  But you're pretty much stuck in the same area throughout the whole game.  It gets boring after awhile because there's nothing new to see in town.<br /><br />Aside from all that, the game wasn't terrible.  It had it's good things.  The characters were charming and I found myself laughing at much of some of the dialogue (the dialogue I actually payed attention to.  Very creative.  You have to stop and wonder, \"What were they smoking when they made this game???  This is your brain on drugs.\"  I especially enjoyed playing as Bowser.  He was the best character to play, his dialogue was funny and he's just awesome.  The only character that can breathe fire as a method of attack.  Peach can block with her umbrella but it's pretty useless IMO.  There probably could have been more interaction from the pixl fairies.  With the exception of Tippi, the others just seem to just \"hang out\".<br /><br />If there's one thing I don't like, is a short game.  This one wasn't too terribly short.  I'm on my 4th day playing and have about 20 hours of play time into it, but I haven't finished it yet.  I'm on Chapter 8 so I'm nearing the end.  The game would be longer if you buy the treasure maps, find the treasures and do the quests for some extra treasure, but the treasures just aren't worth it.  A card, mushroom, eh.  Nothing important.

Not even a demo or the lame bowling sports junk disc that the other Wiis come with.  You get nothing.

I remember the dear, golden age of the 16-bit war between SNES and Genesis and of all my Genesis games, this one was one of my all time favorites.  Matter of fact, I got it out recently and played it again and I'm 33 years old now.  For it's time, this game had really great graphics.  The music was really great and it really seemed to fit the atmosphere of the game.  As I type this review, I can hear the music of the tavern playing now!  I love it.  The characters are great.  I loved this game.<br /><br />The game play takes place in a maze-like labyrinth, in which you have to navigate through.  It can be tricky so you'll have to pay attention to where you're going and where you've been.  The enemies appear at random, as they usually do in these classic RPG games.  You can be running around and them all of a sudden BLAM! You encounter 4 green slimes! lol This can be a bit frustrating, especially when you are really concentrating to get through a particular area of the maze... when your health is low and and you're dying.  Fortunately, there is a spell you can cast that wards off the enemies temporary.<br /><br />It's more than just running around a maze and slaying monsters though.  The storyline is interesting and there are various \"cut scenes\" and transitions throughout the game.  There are only 3 characters in the game and the spell selection is somewhat limited, but still fun nonetheless.  But I really did love this game.

That's right, Mario has been captured by the ghosts and it's up to my Main Man Luigi to save the day.  You guide Luigi through the mansion, sucking up ghosts Ghostbuster style.  I'll admit, this game can be quite difficult and it took some time to finish.  You're in a mansion and several doors are locked.  It can be tricky finding your way around, even if you do have your map.  Many of the ghosts can be difficult, too.  Before you can even fight a ghost, you have to figure out a way to bring it out of hiding and fight you.

I must say, I was disappointed and only played it a few times.  I just couldn't get into it.  For several reasons.  The graphics are ok and it's pretty cool how you can see your own breath and all the ice on the walls, but the sound is terrible.  I  have this installed on Vista x64 with just the built in Realtek sound on the motherboard, but it's distorted.  When in a loud atmosphere, the sound clips, crackles and even completely drops out.  Very annoying.  I've tried tinkering with the settings of my soundcard and in-game, but nothing helped.  Maybe it's supposed to be that way, but I sure hope not.  The game play is also pretty cheesy.  I kept having to touch these bodies and having flashbacks of when I crashed through the ice or something. Another thing that's stupid, is that your health is your body heat.  That's right.  If you get hit by an enemy, it drains your warmth.  How do you get more energy?  You have to restore your warmth by taking off your gloves and sticking your hands by a lightbulb or some other source of heat.  An original idea, but really stupid.  When you see a dead body, you are given a chance to \"save his soul\".  What happens, is you touch the dead frozen body and you are transported back to the past, where the event in which the guy died is re-created and you have a chance to change his fate by doing whatever it is you need to do to save his life.  Usually this is time limited.  If you don't do the even correctly, the dream scene ends and you have to try it again... and again.. and again....  and again...... and again...  and again..... and again.... until you get it right.  Well this annoyed the crap out of me and I stopped playing the game.<br /><br />Aside from that, the overall controls are JUNK.  For example, when you are punching,  you control the type and direction of the punch with the mouse.  yeah.  You hit the button, to punch then push the mouse forward to do a jab, press the button and pull the mouse back for an uppercut, then side to side and when you ad in blocking and dodging, this is just too much of a pain.

First thing I did was pop in COD Ghosts, installed it onto the HDD, and started playing the campaign mode. I have this game for the 360, and comparing the graphics to the PS4, it was only marginally better. The game looks very pretty, don't get me wrong, but it just isn't that big of a jump in graphical power from last generation to this generation (nothing like how when the Sega Dreamcast first came out and blew everything out of the water). Now for the game play itself...... there was some lag during some of the more intense parts of the game. The 360 version definitely handles COD better than the PS4, which makes sense because the PS4 is a brand new system, but then again, it is using an x86 architecture which is theoretically \"easier to program\" for, but I guess they had some trouble porting COD Ghosts.<br /><br />Now let's talk about media capabilities, or lack thereof. Blu-Ray movies play fine, just as you would expect from Sony, however...you cannot play 3D movies! Sony will probably enable this feature later, but for now you can't do it.

First i will give you a little backstory, my first gaming keyboard i bought was a saitek $60 rubber dome with backlighting, back in like 2003 ish, because of care, aka taking it apart cleaning it and all keys through dishwasher if it was really bad and oiling plastics before reasembly i made it last a long time, and i never questioned getting something else until one day i could finally start to feel the wear, the dome was getting soft because of so much use, it almost didnt feel like it had actuation anymore --- that keyboard still works its just old, was an amazing product. Because of so much use on it i became extremely accustomed to it.<br /><br />Keyboards layout -- I never thought it mattered until i tried k70 with cherry browns, keyboard was nicely built but i couldnt get used to the alt being so small as i play arma all the time and alt turns your head, it bothered me, i got used to it to a certain degree was never comfortable though. I also realised i dont like blocky keys and big keys, after going through this k70 a razer with cherry blues (the new open board one forgot the name) and the logitech g810, i slowly realized all the issues i had about boards and how they had to be perfect as none seemed to beat the logitech k120 which i spent 8 dollars on...haha, im an competative gamer too. The g810 had a weird null point after the first actuation where the button wouldnt be registered, unfortunately the grams red keys also have this issue, but its not as noticeable as the whole key is way more linear, its not but the actuaton is very light. So i narrowed it down, i needed low profile keys like my godlike k120, it needed the same or very similar layout, i wanted to try cherry reds since i never did, these tesoro reds i think khail seemed close, its open which is a must these days for me, and it had a metal base all of the little perfections i wanted. And you dont need to run the software if you dont want which comp gamers usually do not want. I would love to try the tesoro blues, maybe in the future. But i didnt like the cherry blues because of travel distance before the actuationand the rebound of the key was slower and weaker than it should be, i feel it should be extremely close to the top if not the very top like most rubber dome, or in particular my k120, all that marketing stuff you see about quickest key is bs, the quickest key is a rubber dome since there is no...no travel before actuation...if the tesoro blues are like that and dont have 1-2mm of travel distance before actuation than they would most likely be better for me than these reds.<br /><br />Manufacturing -- Its made very well, i can see no flaws on my keyboard...great job too many companies have great ideas these days and their product fails due to poor manufacturing.<br /><br />The keys -- ive gone into most keys ive tried, to recap real quick dome keys have quickest actuation, but are dome keys maybe the k120s are slightly different which is why they feel soo good....the g810 they feel nice actually but they have a null point where the key wont register after the first actuation, the cherry browns were nice, but too much travel on the normal blocky keys, couldnt get used to them, cherry blues were nice but too much travel distance before actuation, blues def best for big typers and non gamers. These agile reds i think the khalia brand are nice i honestly dont know much about that company other than for some reason i early sided with cherry for mech switches, although these do feel nice, im still getting used to them but i dont make to many mistakes and its the first day ive been using this board i played one match of overwatch and noticed my play seemed to be very close to my play with the k120 something the other boards couldnt get close to. They arent linear but very close to it, i guess they are kind of like the cherry browns but not as crisp, but if i dont connect with the key perfectly it the switch doesnt get held up or have any resistance...a problem i had with all cherry keys. Ultimately i like these tesoro reds alot but only time will tell, i will upgrade this review if they get worse, or if i test the tesoro blues. One massive complaint i have though...itsnt much but the base of the red keys is red and the base of the blue keys is blue the problem is red isnt neutral, so i can still see the red base of the keys on almost any color from the led's. Also almost forgot the stabilizers on these keys are perfect they are nice and strong and have no sway one side or the other, dont ever change these.<br /><br />The lights -- they are great, i havent installed software and most likely wont so i cant program the individual keys, i think this feature needs to be added for the select few who dont like software, or just axe the software entirely and make it board based, i would love this personally. The options on the baord without software are decent but i wish there was more, also on the key caps they didnt laser etch the bottom letters/numbers on some of the keys like f1-f12 the arrows, they are just printed white on top of the key caps like a basic board...hope they fix this.  Also wish they had a scroll lock light like normal and the gamer mode light was separate like the g810.<br /><br />The cable is perfect dont ever change it., Same with the tesoro logo, low key and not in you face but still noticeable and not over the top.<br /><br />If you have made it this far thanks i know its a info load but trust me deciding on a keyboard can be very hard if your as particular as me.<br /><br />This board is very close to being perfect, the few things i would change are the bases on the keys...just make them black, white or clear, or something very neutral cuz my leds are effected by it, laser etch the whole keycaps writting, some light will still come through, its better than the garbage white print, i wish the caps lock had the other design with the gap so i could tell where my fingers are a little easier, other than that the layout is perfect, the cable is perfect the logo is nice and small, separate the g key light from the num lk and caps lk, and add back a scroll lk, and make them all per key lighting like the g810, dont add a usb pass through or anything like that, get rid of the software entirely add more feature to change and program light on the board it self, make this board default n-key, and 1000hz polling, maybe add a tiny dial for vol control, i dont mind not having the next or back or pause or play because its too easy with my mouse, but changing vol can be a pain, i would make it like the same size if not a little smaller than the logo on the board if i could, but in my opinion the gram is the closest to the perfect board other than the k120, these changes while still small and dont effect the overall that much would still be a huge improvement for me personally, in other words this is closest to perfection on the market. i kind of wish i had other options for keys, would be nice to customize and add cherrys or whatever really, but dont let that deter you, these &#34;tesoro&#34; khalia  reds are nice and feel good like i said i like them better than romer g's keys for the no friction when you dont contact the key correctly...but options are always nice. Oh and the stabilizers are perfect, nice and strong with no sway, dont ever change them please.

Especially fighting game cross over series. Marvel v Capcom is a classic fighting game series and i like many was excited for Infinite. And i thinks it fair to say that i like many others were extremely dissapointed. They included a story which is nice to have in a fighting game but it feels like they to the easy way out. 2 hours is fair for a fighting game campaign but there is a huge problem with the character balancing. I dont mean difficulty I mean how both tank characters and smaller characters are slow and powerfull. It didnt make any sense. If I play as Captain Marvel against the Hulk, I should be faster but weaker. Somehow spiderman is just as slow as thanos and just as powerful. Not at all balanced. And what is up with the level naming or even Ultron Sigma. All they did was take two things put their names together and boom. Its like if you mixed New York and California and called it New Yorkifornia. Or put Captain America and Iron Man together to make Captain Man. But one of if not the biggest offense this game makes is the lack of characters. I cant stand it when games go backwards in content as the series progresses forward.

The characters are written really well; Starlord is a narcissistic leader, Gamora is an aggressive assassin, Drax is the warrior that takes things just a bit too literal, Rocket is the crafty loudmouth, and Groot is Groot.

Horizon Zero Dawn is one the best games that i have played in the passed few years and is definitely one of the best games to have come out for the PS4. You play as a brave explorer and survivor named Aloy as you traverse through a world where technology is as advanced as a fire and spear, but you share this world with robot dinosaurs. As Aloy explores the world she also discovers the secrets of what happend to civilization, why she is treated as an outcast, and what impending threat awaits her perople. She must unite tribes all across the land to work together to stop an army that can do the unthinkable, comminucate with the robots. The characters and enviornments are beautifully deisigned and vastly different. One part of the map can be a dense forest filled with lush greenery and towering trees and another can be a large open desert covered with red and brown sand that makes you fear braving the dust filled sea and its many inhabitants. It is a large open world with something to be seen around every corner. The gameplay missions will vary. One mission will have you fighting an entire bandit camp who are trying to protect their receantly scavenged loot and another may be you quietly trying to stalk a predator who preyed upon an innocent farmer from a remote and defenseless village. You can hunt the robot wildlife and recieve crafiting and upgrade materials from them. I highly recommend hunting, crafting, and upgrading Aloy as much as you can as early as you can so there isnt a disconnect from the game if you need to pause the story progression in order for you to level up. The game also has extra content DLC that comes with the complete edition (which is the copy i am reviewing) or can be purhcased separately through the Playstation store. If you purchase the complete edition all the dlc packs and levels are on the disc but the digital artbook and PS4 theme come on a DLC code.

Doom Eternal is the much awaited sequal to the 2016 masterpiece Doom (Doom 2016). When Doom released in 2016 it not only redesigned the Doom series but also reinvented the fast passed first person shooter genre. It tested player's reflexes and introduced a new blood pumping and heart racing Progresseive Metal/Djent soundtrack thet fits just right to the insane blood and gore filled action that was filling the screen. It was insane. Somehow Doom Eternal managed to take something that was already cranked to the max and pushed it even further. Doom Etenal makes Doom (Doom 2016) look like a calm standard first person shooter. Doom Eternal is faster with a smater AI who work smarter and harder stop you... well will TRY to stop you. Hell has invaded the earth and the one man army is back to continue on his quest to Rip and Tear anything in his path. The games levels are linear with minor puzzle solving elements and rewards you for your exploration. Just like the first game, Doom Eteranal has collectibles through out each map waiting for you find and pick up. Collectibles like extra lives, little figures of the demons and mosters in the game, music tracks that resemble vynal records of heavy metal bands and much more. These collcetibles can all be found and played with in the Fortress of Doom, a hub space base that the doom slayer vists between levels. Aside from the collectibles in the levels there are secret arena battles called gates that can be absolutly brutal if you go in unprepared. Beat all the gates and you can unlock the games ultimate weapon, The Unmaykr.  There are also some extra easter eggs in the fortess like a portrait of the doom slayer with daisy the rabbit and a PC that allows you to play both the orignal Doom and Doom 2. That is two extra full games added in just for fun.  And of course the music is just as good, maybe even better, than the first and fits so well with the action.

This also comes with 1 of 2 available dlcs (downloadable content), Seal The Deal, which has you on a cruz ship with a few new missions and it comes with a harder difficulty mode and challenges for you to do in each area. The dlc is ok, its a nice added treat though. The other dlc, Nyakuza Metro, is much better and is fuller in content. I highly recommend getting it once you are finished with the main game. The main campaign is pretty fair in length and there are tons of extras like collectibles and hidden levels to find.

Everybody's Golf has to be one of the best golf games for this console generation. The single player is pretty simple, you play as your own customizable character entering in tournaments to earn xp. Once enough xp  is collected you go up against a boss in your current rank. There are 3 bosses per rank and each boss comes with challenges. For example one boss may challenge you to 9 holes using only specific types of clubs, or another boss could challenge you to play but you each only have a few seconds to make your shot. It starts off easy with rank 1 and progressively becomes more difficult as you rank up (max rank is 7). You will unlock new courses, clubs, balls, and characters for you to play as or their clothes and body types for you to customize your character with. Your character will also gain individual skill points for each club. A great drive can increase your driver skill and long putt would increase your putter (same idea for each club type). This game also has really fun mutiplayer both online and local.

Ultimately I have to settle on 4, see towards the end.<br /><br />First and foremost, these kits are incredibly generous (and the way a kit should be) when it comes to parts. It comes with two screw drivers (though you might want to keep an extra on standby, the metal is soft), plastic tweezers, double the adhesive pads, and a whole extra set of screws because you probably will strip one or two. Fantastic first impression.<br /><br />Disassembly is what it is, Nintendo made a solid controller so it is a bit tough to get done, especially if you have larger hands. The video is straightforward with it's step by step guide with an awful cheesy inspirational guitar song, no vocals, just mute it. First controller took about 30 minutes, second one 15 minutes. Pretty easy.<br /><br />Three things I don't like.<br />1) The ribbon has a lot of excess slack, not a fan of that. Between L & ZL and R & ZR is too much cable. It's manageable but frustrating. Also along the top, at the 'T' is also a bit long. Also the buttons don't line up center with the rubber nubs but do make contact.<br /><br />2) if it means keeping the cost down so be it but I would have preferred that adhesive tape was preapplied and over a larger area of the pad.<br /><br />3) This is what pushed me to 4 Stars. The video at around 15 minutes shows the ribbon going in all the way. I spent a good 5 minutes of wasted time and frustration until I looked at the original from the controller, the gold contact pins are shorter. So for those wondering, yes, some of the gold pins will stick out. The cable in the video is an older revision.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with the result. The travel is noticeably shorter and instantaneous. Will update after some time on how they hold up but am very pleased.

Breath of the Wild looks great on the Switch and feels like a truer sequel to Xenoblade Chronicles for the Wii/3DS than Xenoblade Chronicles X on the Wii U (Which is an awful game). While the Wii U version suffers from low framerate during many parts (even after the patch), the Switch version doesn't seem to have any issues.<br /><br />Music. Since this game is all about atmosphere, Nintendo decided to go with a softer, more subtle background music for most of the game. There is also various music for different areas, but not as catchy as previous Zelda games.<br /><br />No handholding. The game doesn't treat you like you've never played a video game before. While there is a &#34;tutorial&#34; section at the start, it feels very natural.<br /><br />Voice Acting. This is the first Zelda game to feature voice acting but it's used lightly. You're still going to click through tons of text adjoined by grunts and groans.<br /><br />The Bad Stuff:<br /><br />Tediousness. You will be finding/hunting food and other items. You must cook your food to make hearts and elixirs using recipes. It’s all trial and error. You will have to constantly find new weapons, shields, and bows as they all break. You will need to upgrade slots to hold more of these items. Lastly, you must increase your hearts AND stamina. Menus and item selection are all over the place and very confusing to use. You can access a weapons menu 2 different ways, but only one allows you to drop them. Why not both? They really needed to work more on this.<br /><br />Controls. Those tiny joycons simply don't cut it as a handheld controller. I'm constantly accidently pushing on the control stick when trying to move around the camera during a battle (causing me to zoom in instead). The position of the right stick is also not very ideal. I finally got a Pro Controller and everything is much better.<br /><br />Voices. Obviously adding voices to a Zelda game is going to be controversial. Zelda Cdi anyone? While Link doesn't talk for some reason, almost everyone is well voiced except for Mipha (Zora Princess). She's awful. Luckily, the others aren't so bad. A lot of people complain about Zelda, but I find her to be acceptable.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a Zelda fan there is a whole world to discover and enjoy.

The game's locked at 30FPS but dips well below that usually in Villages or any place with a lot of stuff. You will get used to it but I don't get why they couldn’t optimize it better. The recent update didn't solve this problem. I can verify that the Switch version has a very solid framerate.<br /><br />Controls. Let’s just say, there are a lot of buttons in this game. Most don’t work like previous Zelda games and still, after 60 hours I’m sometimes getting them mixed up, especially in the heat of battle. This isn’t typical for me. I believe it’s just bad button placement. Also, I really hate the placement of the control sticks. I'm used to how they are on the PS4. Have the camera stick directly below the buttons feels very odd and means you're only going to be able to move the camera when you're not doing anything else. This can sometimes cause you to get hurt.<br /><br />Gamepad. Even though a demo a year ago showed the Gamepad being used for the map, much like XBCX the released version has absolutely no gamepad support. Besides being able to play the game on the gamepad instead of your TV. For some odd reason, some genius decided to add a FLASHING text on the gamepad letting you know you can do this. You do get used to it.<br /><br />Voices. Ahem. Obviously adding voices to a Zelda game is going to be controversial. Zelda Cdi anyone? While Link doesn't talk for some reason, almost everyone is well voiced except for Mipha (Zora Princess). It's like they dragged someone off the street and used their first read through. It's just awful and I cringed every time she spoke. Luckily, the others aren't so bad. A lot of people complain about Zelda, but I find her to be acceptable.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a Zelda fan there is a whole world to discover and enjoy.

A re-imagined version of the original, using the motion controls, and no weapons? This could only be awesome! Sadly, it wasn't what I had hoped for, but it's not all bad.<br /><br />The graphics are amazing for a Wii game, and they move extremely smooth, with only a stutter going through doors - but I think that's because the level is loading.<br /><br />The chase scenes are intense, but take a while to get use too. It's too easy to get lost and run around in circles, because you don't have time to check the map as it takes too long to load and unload. Also, I find myself losing control of my character during the heat of the moment, especially after he makes a jump because the camera swings around, causing me to get disoriented. I also have trouble slinging the monsters off me. I read that you have to move the controls slowly, but that's easier said than done when you are in the game. I guess I need more practice.<br /><br />The non-chase scenes are kinda boring. You just walk around reading, opening doors, and finding items you can't do anything with. Since you have no weapons, you never meet any monsters during this time. That is kinda disappointing as you never worry about anything happening. The puzzles are cool, but their aren't enough of them. I like how they use the wiimote as a phone, but sometimes you can't understand what is being said through the tiny speakers.<br /><br />The videos are all awkward.

The first is that the included thumbstick covers are bad. They don't have as much traction as you'd want. Just using the normal thumbsticks is better, plus there are other third party solutions if you really want a cover. The second problem is that these grips are symmetrical, even though the joycons are not.

Once you get past the first few levels, the world is open to you. Go anywhere you want.<br />+ Cool caveman style. The BC setting isn't nearly as overdone as many other video game settings. Solid art direction.<br />+ Melee combat. A lot of 'shooters' play out only at long range, but this isn't the case with Far Cry Primal. Get in there with your primitive weapons and bash face.<br />+ Animal companions. You can tame lots of creatures out in the wilderness. Taming is just throwing out food and holding square though, they probably could have come up with something more fun.<br />+ Mammoth riding. You can ride mammoths and other animal companions. It's fun.<br />+ Simple gathering and crafting. You'll do a lot of gathering, but you won't hunt the map high and low for hours to find an ultra rare component to build a powerful weapon. It's more of a grind.<br />+ Simple base building. You have a home base with ~10 buildings that you can upgrade once or twice each. You don't control the layout or anything. As you do missions around the map your base will increase in population.<br />+ An owl spirit guide. Scout out enemy bases with your owl spirit guide before taking it on.<br />+ A large skill tree. There's lots to unlock and you get points frequently to spend. It's not the kind of game where you need to carefully plan out your character. If something looks cool to you, go for it.<br />+ An option to turn off the 'gathering' animation. This is huge, great job on this oneUbisoft. You do a LOT of gathering in this game and it's boring to sit through the same animation each time over and over.<br />+ Tribal language. Immersive, but subtitles are manditory.<br />+ Stealth gameplay, but they kind of ruin it because your animal companion almost always gives you up.<br /><br />Far Cry Primal DOESN'T HAVE:<br />- Guns. You get a club, a spear, and a bow and arrow with a few variations on each. There are a few subweapons also.<br />- Meaninfgul exploration. The whole world is kind of the same. There's a lot to explore, but mechanically you just highlight something on your map and run there.<br />- A compelling storyline. There is technically a storyline, but just kinda because there has to be.<br />- Compelling characters. Noone stands out.<br />- Variety of enemies. You fight pretty much exclusively other humans with the same weapons as you and four-legged beasts (wolves, tigers, panthers, boars, etc.)<br />- Variety of gameplay. Pretty much every mission feels the same after a while. There are some that are a little different, but for the most part they are very repetitive. Go here and kill these guys, go there and kill these guys.<br />- Variety of combat. With only a few weapons (that are fairly similar) combat can get repetitive. There are some options to spice things up with different tactics, but it's hard to switch away from basic tactics that work.<br />- Dinosaurs.<br />- Replayability.

It's fun and quick to pick up and play, with high production values and a ton of content.  If you've played earlier entries in the series, then you won't be too surprised by this one - it follows a fairly similar formula.  Professor Layton and Luke (his faithful assistant) travel to London in order to see a demonstration of a brand new invention: the Time Machine.  Things go a little haywire with the demonstration, and then a few days later the Professor receives a letter in the mail from Luke - sent from 10 years in the future!  This kicks off a whole adventure of puzzle solving, and things only get crazier from there.<br /><br />This game has 12 chapters, and a total of 165 puzzles - which should be enough to keep anyone busy for a while.  There's a hint system available in case you get stuck, just like previous entries in the series.  As you play through the game, you'll collect coins that can be used to purchase hints if you're having trouble with a puzzle.  If you're REALLY stuck then you can buy a super hint - which is a new addition to the series and pretty much just tells you the answer to the puzzle.  So don't worry too much about getting stuck and frustrated.<br /><br />Professor Layton and the Unwound Future is a lot of fun to look at.  They did a fantastic job with the art style and animation, and there's even some decent voiceover work.  If you're a fan of the Professor Layton series then you should pick this game up immediately.

NHL 09 was awesome, NHL 10 was even better, and now here comes NHL 11 with a whole bunch of new features and improvements - think evolution, not revolution.  If you're new to the NHL franchise, then rest assured that you're buying into a fantastic and fun hockey simulation.  The graphics are great, there are tons of teams to choose from, a huge amount of customization, and solid online functionality.  Want to take on the Canadians with the Bruins in Boston while wearing throwback jerseys?  With three of your friends offline or up to eleven online?  No problem!  Laying a big hit into someone is more satisfying than ever before, and the new physics system allows for some really dynamic situations.<br /><br />Since the NHL formula is so well established at this point, I thought it would be productive to list a version of some major changes you'll notice between NHL 10 and the new NHL 11.  Hopefully this list will help you decide if the new features/improvements are worth it for you:<br /><br />- Passes now happen when you RELEASE the pass trigger, not when you press it.  The strength of your pass is controlled by how long you hold the button before the release.  This is the first major gameplay change I noticed in NHL 11.  The more I play with this, the more I like the change - although as a result I'm having a little more trouble getting one-timers off.<br /><br />- In NHL10 faceoffs almost always resulted in the puck going directly to a player on the ice, in NHL 11 faceoffs are much more dynamic.  It's possible to switch grips, shove, or block your faceoff opponent.  Many more options this time around, faceoffs are definitely more interesting.  In NHL9/10 faceoffs were pretty formulaic and boring.<br /><br />- Broken sticks can happen and take a player mostly out of play.  He'll still be able to kick the puck and block/check, but is obviously at a big disadvantage.  Teammates can hand off their stick as a replacement, or the player can go to the bench to get a new one.  You can also lose your stick if you get cleaned out during a huge hit.<br /><br />- If you are a fan of Madden Ultimate Team mode, then you'll be happy to know that EA has implemented something similar in this game: Hockey Ultimate Team.  This mode is based on collecting trading cards of players, stadiums, coaches, etc. and using these options to build your team.  As you win games, you'll unlock more cards and improve your team.<br /><br />- You can now play online with friends against a purely CPU controller team.  This was a major missing feature from NHL10, and it's great to see that they fixed it.<br /><br />- A `hustle' button (push in left stick) will temporarily give your player a burst of speed.  This feature existed in some previous NHL games, but not in NHL 10.<br /><br />- There's a whole new physics-based engine powering the game.  This can affect lots of different things in the game, from checks to puckhandling to<br /><br />- When laying out a check, you can choose between hitting high and hitting low.  Combined with the new physics engine, this creates some really fun hits.<br /><br />- Reworked trade logic in the `Be a GM' mode.  There are also now both restricted and unrestricted free agents.<br /><br />- If your opponent is lying down on the ice, you can now jump over him.  Hopefully this will cut down on the amount of flopping that is in NHL 10.<br /><br />- EASHL (EA Sports Hockey League) mode now lets you run a full practice game, and increases the number of jersey/team customization options.<br /><br />- A new deke system allows offensive players to counter specific defensive techniques.  There's a deke to counter poke checks, a deke to counter defensemen laying down on the ice, etc.<br /><br />- Disallowed goals.<br /><br />- Playoff beards!<br /><br />Hopefully this helps you make a decision about purchasing (or not purchasing) NHL 11!", "ParentASIN": "B003KZLTXE", "Timestamp": 1283881829000, "ItemName": "NHL 11 - Playstation 3", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.1, "RatingCount": 129, "Price": 16.22, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation 3", "Games"], "Description": "The new Real-Time Physics Engine in NHL11 enhances gameplay with realistic player and puck physics, featuring over 200 gameplay improvements like a revamped faceoff system, quick dekes, and the Hit Stick.

Borderlands is a polish, well-designer RPG/FPS hybrid with a unique art style.  I was expecting to have a great gameplay experience when I fired up Borderlands, but I wasn't expecting my girlfriend to want in on the action.<br /><br />It's hard to say what did it exactly, but I think it was a combination of things.  My fiancee likes to play games, but typically sticks to stuff like [[ASIN:B000GH3PYA Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords]] and [[ASIN:B000U5W3IW Professor Layton and the Curious Village]].  \"Hardcore\" games like Borderlands are typically too difficult for her, and just become a frustrating experience.

This shouldn't be a big surprise, the art style of Borderlands is very highly regarded.  Moving onto actual gameplay, she loves games that we can play together.  Any game with a local coop mode scores big points in her book.  In addition to this, the RPG elements of Borderlands turned out to be key to our enjoyment of the game.  If she was having difficulty with an area, then we'd just level up a bit in order to power up our characters and make things a little easier for her.

It's Resident Evil 4 in a Doom 3 setting.  It's well-paced, gruesome, and legitimately made me jump out of my seat a few times.  I know that a game is scary when something surprising happens and my instinct is to RUN.  It doesn't matter that I have a flamethrower in my hands, I am getting the F&*@ out there there!<br /><br />The graphics are solid, and the style compliments the action very well.  Battling monsters is disgusting and satisfying.  The main combat mechanic revolves around blowing the limbs off of mutant space monsters.  You can pump bullets into bodies, but maximum damage is scored by blasting off arms, legs, and other unnamed appendages.  Every battle leaves behind a mess, and each slain monster feels like a real accomplishment.<br /><br />The control scheme of Dead Space is the best that I've experienced in a survival horror game.  There are a bunch of skills and abilities that need controller real estate, so there's a bit of a necessary learning curve - but once you get the hang of things moving then controlling your character is fairly fluid.  The movement isn't as fluid as your average first-person-shooter, but it's a step ahead of your average slow-paced scarefest.<br /><br />Dead Space's UI, or rather the absence of one, is another major step forward for the genre.  The default view is a typical over-the-shoulder camera, but the interesting thing is that there's no HUD at all.  A tube of blue liquid down the back of your character's space suit represents your life total.  Whenever you bring out a weapon, a small display appears on the model to give you information about your current ammo levels.<br /><br />Access panels and computers are interacted with by just moving towards them and pressing A.  If an info panel pops up, or you bring up the full menu then it appears as a 3D object (a full in-world textured quad) in the scene.  It's a bit tough to describe, but it really works.  Things are so much scarier creeping down a hallway all alone without even a HUD standing by your side.  As far as I'm concerned, Dead Space's UI should be the genre standard moving forward.<br /><br />The story is nothing special, but functional.

It's one of the best RPGs of the 16-bit era, and has held up reasonable well.  Chrono Trigger tells a sprawling story across many different regions of space and time.  You play as a boy who meets, goes back in time and meets a frog, goes forward in time and meets a robot, and then eventually battles an ultimate evil.  It's a simple but solid story with many different possible endings depending on the choices you make throughout the game.<br /><br />Chrono Trigger plays exactly how you would expect a SNES RPG to play.  There aren't many surprises here.  There are a few improvements designed to add on present day RPG staples (a bestiary, various galleries, an item encyclopedia, etc) and some additions to make Chrono Trigger fans happy (a few bonus dungeons and an alternate ending).  Other than these features, you're basically playing the same game that was on the SNES.<br /><br />The DS doesn't really add a whole ton to Chrono Trigger.  The extra screen real estate spreads out the information display, which is definitely helpful, and allows a map of the current area to be displayed on screen at all time.  There is an option to use the stylus as input instead of the conventional controls, but I found this setup clunky and quickly went back to the standard controls.<br /><br />There's not a whole lot left for me to say here.  There are two different demographics that I think will enjoy Chrono Trigger DS:  RPG players interested in learning something about the \"sort of old days\", and Chrono Trigger fans looking for an excuse to replay one of their favorite games.

It reminds me of games like Resident Evil and Dead Space - if you liked those, then you will probably like Condemned.<br /><br />The strangest thing in the world of Condemned, from a gameplay point of view, is the lack of an inventory.  You can't horde health packs, you're limited to one weapon at a time, and there are no special items to keep track of.  This is very odd for a combination FPS/survival horror game; both of those genres typically love to give you lots of things to collect.  It's somewhat refreshing to play a game of this style and not constantly worry about rationing out bullets and health packs.<br /><br />Firearms are very rare in Condemned, and when you do come across one chances are it will only have a few bullets left.  Normally this means that you'll have an easier time taking out the next few bad guys, and then it's time to find a new weapon.  The majority of the combat takes place in up-close melee battles.  Your weapon?  Anything you can find - almost literally.  During my playthrough of Condemned I bludgeoned enemies with the following items (not a complete list): papercutters, different types of pipes, locker doors, desk drawers, fire axes, signs, shovels, mannequin arms, crowbars, sledgehammers, meat cleavers, fire pokers, and many different 2x4s (straight up, filled with bolts or nails, flaming).<br /><br />These weapons are plentiful and scattered everywhere through the world.  They each have different attributes in strength, speed, blocking, and reach - it's up to you to decide which weapon attributes are most important.  Finished firing off the last shell from the shotgun that you picked up?  Head over to the corner and yank a pipe off of the wall to continue your assault.  Or maybe you want to grab the 2x4 filled with nails on the ground over there, the choice is yours.<br /><br />The combat takes a bit of getting used to, for two different reasons.  As mentioned above, it's largely melee combat - which is not very common for a first person game.  You do get a taser and the occasional firearm to bring things back into familiar ground - but the majority of the game you'll be slugging it out hand to hand.  Once you get used to blocking, parrying, staying out of range, waiting for your opening, and taking fights a bit more slowly than usual the combat system is a lot of fun.  Running ahead and swinging wildly is definitely not a recipe for success; if you're looking for a fast-paced action game, then Condemned is definitely not for you.<br /><br />The second attribute that gives combat in Condemned a unique taste is the subject matter.  You play as an FBI agent tracking down a murder case, a bizarre serial killer who poses his victims with mannequins after taking them out.  One thing leads to another and you end up on the run from your own agency, scampering through the mean streets (well, mostly the mean buildings) of a completely broken down New York-ish setting.  Your goal is probably pretty obvious: get the bad guy before he gets you.  In addition to the combat there's some minor evidence gathering, after all you are a detective.  This consists mostly of small mini-games to find and collect samples to wire back to the lab in order to get some information about the crime scene and move the story along.<br /><br />Condemned's version of New York is 'Metro City', a strange world where the subways still run on a schedule but there isn't a single normal person anywhere to be found.  Well there are a few (the supporting cast), but other than that you will spend the majority of your time with 'the influenced' - people of the street strung out on some weird drug that apparently compels them to grab a crowbar or shovel and just start swinging at whatever is moving.<br /><br />So how does all of this give Condemned's combat a unique taste?  I've played a huge number of violent games, and they rarely cause me to miss a step - but most of the time these involve blasting demons or taking out zombies.  When they do involve 'real life' violence, maybe something like Grand Theft Auto, it's usually very over the top or abstracted.  This is not the case at all in Condemned.  The battles are violent and not really glorified.  When you finish beating down a strung out drug addict with a sledgehammer, you really feel like you just finished beating down a strung out drug addict with a sledge hammer.  There's no glorious UI sound with a health pack drop or anything, just a dead homeless guy with perhaps the last remnants of his dying wail still echoing through the concrete and metal.  You definitely have to be ok with this to enjoy Condemned.", "ParentASIN": "B001EYUPCO", "Timestamp": 1283543036000, "ItemName": "Condemned: Criminal Origins (Dvd) - PC", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 3.9, "RatingCount": 45, "Price": 50.0, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "Xbox Systems", "Xbox 360", "Games"], "Description": "In the game, players face a shortage of weapons and ammunition, making them vulnerable to intelligent, strategic enemies.

Read on if you want to find out why.<br /><br />Folklore's style is absolutely fantastic.  This is the type of game that Neil Gaiman would envision on one of his really, really good days.  The environments are colorful and dream-like, just filled to the absolute brim with wonder.  I spent a good ten minutes early on wandering around an empty field just watching all sorts of sparkles and colors flow around the world.<br /><br />This charming world frames a dark story about a girl named Ellen who lost her mother as a small child.  As the game begins, she receives an obviously surprising letter from her long dead mother - asking her to come to a small village named Doolin.  At the same time a dude named Keats, who works at a magazine that covers the paranormal, receives a phone call from a woman rambling on about magic and Doolin Village.  Keats decides to go check things out, hoping to land a scoop.<br /><br />The two characters above both arrive safely in Doolin and some serious stuff starts to go down.  The story is told through a variety of techniques, from traditional RPG fare like cutscenes and character models trading text boxes back and forth to something a bit more progressive - a sort of animated comic book feel with frames and speech bubbles.  This technique works very well and definitely keeps the storytelling feeling fresh.<br /><br />The bulk of the gameplay revolves around battling weird monsters, the Folk.  As you progress through the game Folk, you are able to rip out the Id (soul) of a wounded Folk in order to gain their powers.  This is how you unlock abilities and become more powerful as the game moves along.  Each Folk has a few different powers available, ranging from various attacks and shields to combo extensions and status bonuses.<br /><br />Early on in the game you run into a Folk named Pouke, and absorbing his Id allows you to summon Pouke and perform a basic attack.  Absorb five or ten more Pouke Ids and you'll increase the number of attacks in your basic combo.  You'll also find a weird Folk named Henky, who flies around shooting bubbles.  Absorb his Id and you'll be able to fire off bubbles to take down enemies up in the air.  Give Henky five Pine Nuts, and you'll 'level up' your mastery of the Henky Folk and reduce the MP consumption.  Some Folk abilities require you to provide items, some require you to defeat a specific Folk with another specific Folk, and so on down the line.<br /><br />Once you gain a bunch of Folk abilities, you're able to mix and match as you see fit and assign each one to a button on the controller.  This allows you to customize your Folk Id repertoire and design an arsenal that fits your style.  It's a lot of fun to determine the weak points of new enemies and figure out the best way to defeat them.  It's very satisfying to win a battle after busting out three or four completely different abilities.  Visually the combat looks great and gives you plenty of sweet effects to keep your interest - the only bummer is that the framerate occasionally reaches the 'starting to get painful' level.<br /><br />Based on everything I've said thus far, Folklore sounds totally badass doesn't it?  Sure it does, and this is what makes it such a disappointing game.  As I mentioned above, there are two main characters: Keats and Ellen.  They aren't just main characters, they are both playable characters - which is the beginning of the problem.<br /><br />The game is divided up into a number of different chapters.  Let's say that you play and complete chapter one with Keats - you do not have the option of playing chapter two with Ellen.  In order to play chapter two with Ellen, you need to go back and replay chapter one with her first.  There are minor differences in the how the same chapters plays out with two different characters (different Folk abilities, some different items and abilities, different views of the storyline), but in practice things are very much the same.<br /><br />After figuring out how things worked, I decided that playing every level through twice in a row is for suckers - I chose Ellen and decided to play through the entire game as her.  Maybe I'd miss part of the story, but hey, that's how things go.  If I ever decide to pick up the game and play it again in five years I'll play as Keats and get a different view on things.<br /><br />Everything was going according to plan until I hit a chapter and realized that I needed Keats to be up to the same level as Emily in order to continue with the game.  This meant putting on the breaks and replaying the entire games with Keats.  The idea of stopping at (or towards) the climax of a game in order to replay the entire thing took all of the wind out of Folklore's sails for me.  I guess this was a way to turn a six hour game into a twelve hour game?  I don't really know, but it turned an awesome gaming experience for me into a terrible one.  As much as I got out of the game, I just never went back to it.  I just don't have enough time to play video games these days, and I definitely don't want to spend that time replaying something that I just played.  What a bummer.<br /><br />With all of that being said, I can't wait for Folklore 2.", "ParentASIN": "B000UW1YBW", "Timestamp": 1283542929000, "ItemName": "Folklore - Playstation 3", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.4, "RatingCount": 277, "Price": 91.17, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation 3", "Games"], "Description": "In this game, players battle and capture monsters to harness their powers, enhancing their strength for future encounters.

Here's a rundown of my experience:<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />- The game moved back to the original Puzzle Quest icon-matching formula, without any of the multi-directional weirdness of Galactrix.<br />- They did a better job of making the different classes play out in different ways.<br />- Quick load times.  Galactrix had long long times that were really annoying for a game of this style.<br />- You actually go into towns, instead of just staying up on the world map like in the first Puzzle Quest.  This makes the game and world feel much more intimate.<br />- The actual battles are faster and more streamlined than in the original.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />- Many things are much simpler than the original Puzzle Quest.  The equipment is simpler, they removed things like mounts, castle sieges, and item creation.  Lots of people will not even notice they are gone, but for the truly involved there's something missing.<br />- When it comes down to it, this game is just more Puzzle Quest.  This isn't _necessarily_ a bad thing, but the gameplay experience is just not significantly different, and I can see many people being happy by just sticking with the first game in the series.<br />- It's a bummer that the only way to control the game is with the stylus.  There's no reason why I shouldn't be able to use the d-pad as an alternate control method.<br />- The music is pretty uninspired.  Low quality and fairly boring.<br />- Puzzle Quest 2 is easy.

In the beginning, as you are learning the ropes, the fish will more likely ignore your lures rather than bite at the line.  In a half hour of fishing, you may catch 2-3 fish, if you're lucky.  The graphics above water are pretty good for being a 5 year old game.  Below the surface, they are fair.  The fish try to jump when hooked which causes my TV screen to go into hyper-active mode and spazz out... I can't even watch the screen.  Many fish come right to the boat... way too easily.  Some fight, and when that happens, the game can be semi-enjoyable. Oh... before I digress any further... there is NO TROLLING MODE!  You're supposed to maneuver down these twisting narrow sections of lakes using a 225 hsp outboard, but no chance to move along quietly with a trolling motor! Crazy... The numerous glitches at times can get tiresome.  They include: virtually NO tension when reeling in a fish on the 1st  round of a tournament... which leads to most fish throwing the hook; the character picking up the fish in a very strange manner - with his/her arm sticking through the body of the fish on some occasions (hard to explain until you see what I mean); and finally you have to basically stop reeling in the lure and make it come to almost a complete standstill in order to get the fish to bite... not very realistic!  The number of fishing games for the XBOX is definitely limited, so I'm glad to have this one to try once in a while. However, it is not nearly as good as Bass Pro's The Strike.  It is slightly better than the latest Activision fishing game.  You may want to rent this before you buy, unless you're an avid virtual fishing fan looking for something else to try.

Anyway, I have played this game for almost a month now, and have learned most of the ins and outs.  First, the game does look good, and driving the boat around the lakes is kind of fun and relaxing.  The fish look pretty good too.  BUT, the fishing pole/reel peripheral controller is a piece of junk.  I've tried to contact Activision and get an email back from them that I can't reply to directly.  ACTIVISION wants PROOF that I purchased the game within the last 6 months. (HEY ACTIVISION... IT'S ONLY BEEN RELEASED FOR 1 MONTH!). It appears that A LOT of people who bought the \"bundle\" are having issues with this lousy excuse for a fishing reel controller.  Every fish you eventually learn to catch follows the same BORING approach to the boat.  I had to switch over to the regular XBOX controller to get the fish to the boat before they could get away (DON'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO DO THIS WITH THE ROD/REEL PERIPHERAL CONTROLLER... IT'S SO FRUSTRATING!!!).  So... my suggestion is if you buy this game, just get the game... NOT the bundle. I don't know much about XBOX live, but hopefully there will be enough complaints about this game so that Activision does something to tweak the controller/gameplay online.  OH... another let down... HEY ACTIVISION... IT'S 2010... HOW ABOUT PUTTING VIBRATION ON THE CONTROLLER???  Yes... there is NO vibration AT ALL... just another boring attribute to a so-so fishing game.  Final summary: Looks good, looks like a lot of time and effort went into making this game, but the fishing aspect (THE MAIN REASON FOR BUYING A FISHING GAME...

I have \"played\" the game for 2 hours... caught 1 fish... and still haven't figured out how to cast nor how to maneuver the rod to attract fish to the lure.  VERY FRUSTRATING!!!  The graphics while you are driving around the lake are pretty good... but the underwater graphics are never really very clear, nor do they vary very much... I guess you're supposed to feel like you're actually seeing the fish through the water.  Using the tutorial does nothing except make you more and more frustrated as you try to change tactics and realize that nothing works. The fish I have seen swimming around look pretty good, but I've only caught a pike thusfar.

The world is supposed to be some horror to live in that needs saving, but aside from the IPD outbreaks, most of the in game NPCs are all super cheerful, there's no imagery that would indicate overcrowding or starvation, etc.  There's no subtext to the story, it's just text, and is rarely backed up by anything other than being told by someone to go somewhere to do something.

To be sure, it is a B-title. There are some factors in it's favor, but you have to be willing to adjust your expectations to account for the time the game was made.  You may not come away with a deep appreciation for it, but you may end up, like it's small cult following, enjoying it despite it's shortcomings.<br />To be clear, Overblood isn't a survival horror game.  It is a sci-fi survival/adventure game. It is most similar to the title 'Disaster Report'. It is not an action title. It is about exploration, puzzle solving, and escape. The protagonist, Raz, wakes with amnesia in a cryogenic vault in an underground research facility where an earthquake has occurred. Like Disaster Report, aftershocks continue as the game progresses, making for some dangerous situations.  Movement and character animations are definitely clunky. Collision detection is not very good, and it can be difficult to tell where to activate certain items. Hand to hand combat is laughable.  On the other hand, the base is rendered in 3d polygons, not pre-rendered backgrounds, and this was an innovation for it's time. The game has several different cameras you can access, and 2 different playable characters at any given time. It's important to remember that before titles like Tomb Raider and Super Mario 64 hit the market, in-game 3D cameras were notoriously wonky. Years of experimenting had to be done before the subtle movements we take for granted these days were standardized. You have to accept that when you play Overblood.  It's an early 3d title, but it does not have grievously unforgivable camera movements like say, Rascal.<br />Sound effects and voicework are hit and miss, though the death scream of Raz will definitely make you jump.  The music by Hiroaki Iwatani was minimalist, ambient and atmospheric.  A few tracks hauntingly so, and go a long way toward cementing the eerie, lonely tone of this game. Ultimately, isolation and exploration is what Overblood is about, and why the game still holds up to being replayed.  You do want Raz to escape, and find his answers. Youtube may have more than a few snarky video playthroughs on how bad the game is, but yet, people keep playing it.

What follows is a romanticized sci-fi mini epic that mostly does what it sets out to do. The story is unconventionally structured and open ended enough to give a sense of a larger game world that could be fleshed out further. And the story takes some unexpected turns and like a memorable old school sci-fi story, ends on a soberly ironic note. Art design is a cool mix of asian deco and Flash Gordon style tech... Firefly fans will likely get a charge out of the look, here. In game voicework and music by Nitin Sawhney are top quality.<br /><br />Then there's the gameplay.<br />Enough's been made of linear jumping sections, I didn't have a problem with that so much, I felt it streamlined the action so you could enjoy the scenery more, and the scenery's nice (especially the Manhattan modeled after the 'Life After People' History Channel series).. The combat felt a little loose in the camera, but did manage to convey a sense of heaviness to the swings, so not bad, but not great. The best sequences involve (surprise) using both Trip and Monkey to overcome obstacles. They play well, and even get some emotion going in a few places. Reminiscent of Ico in that you are guiding the girl to safety, but more modern in that she can take care of herself.. except when she's being carried off by some giant creature that you have to chase on your hover board.. err - \"Cloud\".<br /><br />Ok. Must there always be a floaty wobbly thing that steers like a waterbed in sci fi games? Can we commit to not doing the floaty thing anymore? The worser sin of doing chase scenes with them? It's not fun. Stop it. Seriously.<br /><br />And the same goes for the 'green' level. You know the 'green' level? It's in every sci fi fantasy adventure game.. & it's in this one. The puke green industrial level with the toxic ooze and the wrecked machines that offers nothing except another visually uninspired slog to get to the chapter you're trying to get to. More insulting is that the character you meet on the green level in Enslaved is dressed (and acts for the most part) like a pig.. more painfully reminiscent of Beyond Good & Evil since you're already fighting with a bo staff just like Jade. An homage? It doesn't feel like one, it just feels cheap.<br /><br />Those things cost this game some emotional investment, which is bad because mood is where this game succeeds. It's as if the idea of uneasy alliance seems to have penetrated this game down to it's core, but for the worse. For every sequence that bonds you with the characters (the appearance of the 'dogs', the bridge sequence) there were plenty of others including the above-mentioned that would de-invest you back into playing by rote through sequences you felt you played before. So, it's hard for me to strongly recommend this title on gameplay. At all.<br /><br />On the other hand, I felt the art and the overall beauty of this game make it worth playing, if only once.

He's lost his memory, someone's infected him with a virus that's turned him into a superpowered killing machine, the infection is spreading all over Manhattan spawning super zombies and whatnot, and the military is declaring martial law.  It's getting ugly.<br /><br />The game is divided into GTA style missions that can take on at your leisure, or free roam the map, looking for side missions. Side missions usually involve assassinating/absorbing a target, or using an ability repeatedly, like jump or fly, or destroy a building loaded with infection, or a military base, etc. As the game progresses, so does the advance of the virus, and more and more of the map gets taken over with infected zombie areas, and conversely, military controlled bases. The player is free to destroy or aid either side.  Some side quests will have you aiding one side or the other in a battle royale.<br /><br />This game does alot of things right. It's fast paced and fun, and controls easy.  From the start, you're immediately thrown into the action, and the superpowers work nicely and make you feel - superpowered. There's none of that needing to grind away just to get the next small upgrade. Most of the powers are pretty substantial in their own right, are easy to pull off, and in any case there's usually several different ways to attack a target, so you never feel underpowered.<br /><br />A few words on powers: You can throw cars, run up buildings, do Hulk-style jumps, rip central air units off of building roofs and hurl them into crowded intersections, drop kick helicopters, hijack tanks, cut people in half with razor sharp claws, create explosions of spikes that impale dozens of pedestrians, chainwhip a crowd of people in half, do kneeplants into people's faces to absorb them and steal their identity, and combinations.. you can grab a car and sprint up a building and do a jump with a 360 spin and throw the car.  For stealth's sake you can assume the appearance of any person on the street, and this is very handy when eluding the military.<br /><br />The downside is that the game really has no morality built into it, it has no heart.  The story cutscenes tell you that you are basically a decent guy on a mission of vengeance against the people who infected you, but once you start using your powers in the city, you're like as not going to accidentally start killing people by the hundreds, and the fact is, it's darkly amusing fun, and there's no consequences. The mayhem you can cause in this game puts GTA IV to shame, and yes, it's a blast going on mindless rampages. But there's no kidding yourself that Alex Mercer is a hero. The story may try to say so, but the gameplay doesn't.  Prototype is a guilty pleasure game for grownups. It's not anything else.<br /><br />The other downside for this gamer is that the graphics are a little bland in color and depth- they're comic bookish at best, some ugly character models, although the simplicity does seem to lend itself to giving the game a strong sense of speed..

I fell in love with the idiosyncrasies of the game as much as the structure, the art design, and music. And like a Spielberg summer blockbuster, every few years a new Final Fantasy title comes out to wow it's base of loyal fans, and maybe draw some new ones.  When I heard there was to be a XIII, I decided to buy a PS3, because I knew no matter what, that the bar would be set high.<br /><br />For graphics and sound and animations, yes.. very high. Every vista stuns, every cloud, bush, bit of fog, wisp of hair is painstakingly rendered in sparkling perfection... but for story, structure, concept? This is the thinnest, lamest Final Fantasy ever.  Anyone who ever played Square's 'the Bouncer' knows what I'm talking about; Run down a hallway/fight something/watch a cutscene/do you want to save?/repeat. It's a fine formula for a brawler, but a bad one for an RPG series that's known for diversity of gameplay ideas.<br /><br />And that's not the only meat that's gone. Unlike older Final Fantasies, there is no deeply convoluted, layered storyline, here.  Everything is black and white to the point theres almost no need for dialogue. Coccoon is good, Pulse is bad, Fal'cie force quests on people and arm them with magic to carry them out. Pulse Fal'cie create Pulse L'cie who have to destroy Coccoon.  Coccoon Fal'cie create Coccoon L'cie who have to destroy Pulse...<br /><br />If those last 3 sentences grated on your nerves at all nothing can prepare you for the hours and hours you're going to have to hear those same terms repeated over and over till they become maddening jabber.<br /><br />What else is gone?  A Worldmap, towns, shops (there's a \"streamlined\" online shop feature), NPCs, side quests. None of those fun side jobs to enjoyably kill time. All there is to do is run or walk in a mostly straight line to the next point on the map, and don't worry about returning to anyplace you've visited either, there's no airship.  Just push forward on the pad and fight. And fight.<br /><br />Fighting is actually kind of fun.  For veterans of the series, the combat is a fast paced 'slam' affair where you designate teams with different jobs to different members, and then switch them on the fly.

Both games utilized branching chapters with different character POV, as well as a countdown \"barometer\" to heighten the tension.<br /><br />While structurally similar, Heavy Rain is at it's best a much more beautiful, and troubling urban vision... not getting bogged down in supernatural or sci-fi conventions requiring copious suspension of disbelief, it instead strives vigorously to create REAL tension by taking the player to places rarely seen in videogames. It's settings are striking and depressing and highlight the frailty of the characters to wonderful effect. It has a quality of truthfulness to it only hinted at in most games. As videogame art, it is a real high note.<br /><br />The downside, is that you really can't break out of the game's underlying design aesthetic of appearance of choice. In no way does the game adapt or change it's storyline depending on the decisions you make. It tells it's story and prompts you to react or not to react to different situations. There are 'stronger' or 'weaker' cutscenes that will follow certain actions, but they do not alter where the story goes.<br /><br />Co-dependency of the character arcs is another problem. In order to use another character more fully (see more cutscenes that fill out the story), you may find you have to screw up with the one you're playing. This is a very counter-intuitive context in a story with high emotional stakes, like Heavy Rain.<br /><br />There is some questionable stereotyping of women here as well, either depicting women as sex objects, or failures without men, or falling in \"love\" for no apparent reason. It would not bother me as much as it did if other aspects of the story were more tawdry and b-grade, but in a game trying so hard to sell the idea of connection with family and weathering tragedy, using women (and in particular, mothers) as props seemed in questionable taste.<br /><br />Cliched characters aside Heavy Rain is still a dazzling and visceral experience with an evocative message about fatherhood, and it's a joy to look at... but there's not too much to do once you've beaten it once. You get locked up in the characters the first time you play and replaying it just feels cheap. Indigo Prophecy differed in this perhaps in that the 'mystery' really wasn't central to the plot, so replaying that game felt more natural.<br /><br />I would recommend this game as a rent, to buy would depend on the taste of the gamer, although it's certainly demo material.<br /><br />Definitely R Rated, adult themed game.

Everything about this game drags. The movement is sluggish, the menus are sluggish. Game saves take about 2 minutes. Saved photographs appear about 1/3 of the screen size and cannot be enlarged or zoomed. No thoughtful collision detection among the animals, either. They threw alot of money at studying film footage of real animals, with the downside that all the animal movements seem limited to a 2D (film) scheme with no forethought about 3D collision detection. All the animals in the game do awkward headbutts with eachother, where one will keep moving in the direction it was going, while the other remains stuck, uselessly moving it's legs; realism- zero.  The fact that the environments are mostly flat and undetailed doesn't sell photorealism, either.  Photography enthusiasts will presumably enjoy the detail of having real SONY cameras to choose from, as well as the National Geographic seal of approval, what value they have in terms of gameplay I don't know.<br /><br />The gameplay: finding a spot and wait.<br />If you run or shift your position, any animal close to you will startle and run, but stay still for a few seconds and you're completely invisible again. An animal will walk toward you, you wait for it's behaviors to cycle to the one you're trying to 'get', take picture.<br /><br />The problem is that different animal behaviors are only unlocked as you get photo assignments to photograph a particular behavior... in other words, the Hippos won't yawn until you take the 'photograph the hippo yawning' mission. The cheetah won't attack it's prey until you pick the 'photograph the cheetah attacking it's prey' mission. This wouldn't be a big deal if movement was fast, which it's not. There no Zip or Goto Area function; everytime you want to proceed to an area you've already been, it's a slow jeep drive across the same flat, uneventful terrain, and everytime you do, the ingame music goes on, an over the top  'Jurassic park'-ish theme, that clashes hard with the mood of thoughful photography.<br /><br />Natsume would have done well to examine what worked about the gameplay structure in Pokemon Snap! or the photography segments in Beyond Good & Evil, or how African environments were rendered in FarCry2.<br /><br />As it is, Afrika succeeds neither as a game, nor as a simulation, because it's neither fun, nor realistic.

Alot of people felt it was a nice tech demo for graphics, but otherwise it just a platformer game with a few simple objectives that went on way too long.  I agreed, but still enjoyed it, and was curious to get through to the end to find out where the story was going.<br /><br />I was a mollified to see that in the interest of making a larger game, the graphics in 2 have been simplified to run more smoothly. AC2 is full of blurred edges and textures and a muddy color palette. The shadows are blocky, and don't move realistically (especially on faces in some closeups). Character models show some weird artifacts. Distances are flattened in a perpetual haze. One thing I really loved about AC1 was how you could stop and look at any street and appreciate all the fine detail. Not so here.  There ARE more people types in the street in AC2, but otherwise this is a graphical downgrade that seems to want to conjure up comparisons to an oil paint 'look'. AC1 may have had hiccups and slowdown, but it 'popped' and looked alot cleaner on my hi-def TV than this.<br /><br />The gameplay... might be a matter of taste.  If you wanted more step & fetch, this game has it.  You'll do alot more running back and forth, getting letters, documents, delivering boxes, carrying bodies, beating up philandering boyfriends, following people, etc. Having to manually follow someone who you are having a conversation with was a little weird. There is also the addition of an ingame economy, so you can now rob dead people, pickpocket, buy paintings, change the color of your clothing, repair your armor and weapons, hire prostitutes to lure guards (fun!), throw money in the street to draw a crowd... Point to point races against local couriers will challenge your ability to find the quickest route across the rooftops and pray Ezio doesn't 'stick' to the wrong surface. Simple Puzzle segments scattered throughout the game world will illuminate more of the games backstory.  A notoriety 'system' will force you to remove wanted posters (never on the street, always on second story balconies, for some reason) and kill local police. Visit Leonardo Da Vinci who will create weaponry for you if you have the right design sketches and later unlock a nice flying mission...<br /><br />The core experience of the game hasn't changed at all, though. The running over rooftops is still a breeze (unless you're on a clock), and the combat is workable and fun, though the context sensitive scheme will occasionally frustrate, BUT - just like AC1, you don't ever get to perform a stealth kill on any of the games main-story targets... you track them, listen to a speech, run them down, run them through in front of a huge crowd, and then run like hell as dozens of screaming guards chase after you. It's hardly stealthy and you've done this already.<br /><br />The story? You're the lusty son of a proud nobleman, wronged by a conspiracy involving the Assassins and the Templars, and nothing is what it seems bla bla bla etc... I will give that Ezio is a little more likable than Alta'ir of the first game.. but it didn't make me care about him or his family, or what was going on, and Desmond simply switching teams to be exploited by Lucy and her friends instead of the evil Abstergo Company  didn't impress me much, either. I thought Desmond was a dullard in the first game, but the Holy Land story was more crackling than this.

Across the board, everybody said two things: &#34;Ooooooh, pretty lights! The keyboard feels nicer than the crap Dell sends as default, but the other mechanical keyboards feel better, though this is quieter.&#34;<br /><br />To expand, yes, the lights are pretty. I wouldn't allow them in a work environment because, by default, the keys light up for a second after getting pressed and that has &#34;guess my password&#34; written all over it. I know they can be overridden, but this seems like one extra hole I'd have to patch up from an IT perspective. But, the lights are pretty awesome!

They aren't the red or black buttons, which most people (including myself) prefer, but these are much more quiet. Significantly. Those who tried it did say that the louder ones would not be good in a cubicle environment because the neighbor would always hear them typing. So they actually preferred this keyboard (or something like it) in those situations.<br /><br />I'm surprised how quiet it actually is, while still being pretty responsive to the touch. Not my favorite to type on, but it is still a positive experience.<br /><br />Some other things: I like how you can customize the light show. I also like the media bar in the function keys, though it does take a bit of getting used to finding the function key just right to the (huge) space bar.<br /><br />At two hundred bucks, I'm a little surprised that this keyboard doesn't have USB 3.0 built into the back, but only USB 2.0. I'd expect nothing but the best when spending that much money.<br /><br />Which brings me to the build of the keyboard as a whole... it feels kind of light and flimsy.

I am now wondering if Nintendo could turn around and win the console war this round despite the higher end graphics offered by the other two.<br /><br />The biggest advantage that the Wii has is price.  To get the entire console at $250 is amazing!  And I appreciate their simplicity in offering only one console instead of a core system and a higher-end system, something that aggravated me about the other two consoles.<br /><br />On the innovative side, the Wii comes now with the remote and nunchunk.  I was pretty surprised while playing to learn that the remote actually has a speaker inside.  That is pretty new as well.  But the remote looks like a small TV remote and adds a new level of flexibility to gameplay.  For one, if you point at the screen then it can pretty much function as a mouse.  It can also detect if the remote tilts in one way or the other.  For instance, while bowling if you tilt the remote to the left when releasing the ball then the ball will curve left.  In boxing, if you lean to the right then the body of your boxer leans to the right to dodge a blow from your opponent.  There is a driving game where you can use the remote as a steering wheel.  Again, this is completely innovative on Nintendo's part.<br /><br />One complaint I have heard about the Wii remote is that it is easy to break once you get into the game.  I can see why.  While playing baseball or golf you swing it like a bat or a club.  Also in baseball you throw it like a baseball while pitching.  Instinct almost kicks in and makes me want to let go of the remote during the pitching part of baseball.<br /><br />There is a learning curve to the remote as well.  However, the Wii comes with Wii Sports to get you familiar (like how Bill Gates threw in Solitaire into Windows to help learn the mouse).  Wii Sports will not keep you entertained for long because they become quite boring after you master the use of the remote but it does do a good job of getting you over the curve.<br /><br />The remotes are also in short demand right now and most games seem to have written the use of the remotes into the games as an afterthought (the largest exception being Zelda).  But I think games in the future will be written throughout with the remote and nunchunk in mind and these games are going to be amazing.<br /><br />The graphics are not as impressive as what you'll see on the XBox360 and the PS3, but the DVD quality is good enough when you are more interested in playing and having fun.  Don't get me wrong, the 1080 resolution is very impressive.  But after you get into a game, the graphic difference becomes irrelevant if you are having fun.  And the Nintendo Wii is a load of fun!!<br /><br />One last note.  While searching for a Wii I went to many stores (Best Buy, a few WalMarts, Target, several Game Stops and many others).  I noticed that a lot of the XBox360's and PS3's were frozen or out of order.  Very few demo machines actually worked.  But I never once saw a Wii not working though all but once had a classic controller instead of the new remote.  I've read that PS3's can overheat and the XBox360 can crash on occasion (Windows!!  Typical).  So I'm glad that the Wii comes out quite solid.<br /><br />So, Wii loses in graphic capabilities but wins in price, fun, stability, and innovation.

Here is what I see from the game.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />1)  Addicting!!!!  I'm talking \"I'm gonna lose my job because I stay up all night playing this and almost fall asleep at my desk\" type of addicting.  Yes, this is more addicting than Bejewelled.<br /><br />2)  Creating Characters.  Bar none, this gives you the ability to create the most unique look.  I've never seen two people look exactly the same.  I mean it literally when I say that there are a million possible looks.... even down to the arrangements of the freckles on your face.  And that is just the human race.  There are other races and so many options you can take with each.<br /><br />3)  Different types of experience/diversity of professions.  There are so many professions you can undertake.  You can be a medic/doctor and heal yourself and others.  You can be a scout and trap animals.  You can be a merchant.  You can be a dancer/entertainer.  You can even be a politician and run for office!!  There are just soooooo many things you can do and become on this game.<br /><br />4)  Even if you can play for 15 minutes a day, you can still get stuff done on here.  Or, you can spend hours and hours playing.  You can even set up a macro to do some things for you and then walk away from the keyboard for an hour or two and come back to see how you did.  Very useful for surveyors and medics!<br /><br />Neutral:<br /><br />1)  Limits on skills.  I think this number is waaaay to low.  You can master two or three professions and then, that is it!!!  You can unlearn these professions and start learning another one.  This is good so that no character gets too powerful, but this is also bad because you can't have two characters from the same account on the same server.  See negative #5 below for more info.<br /><br />2)  Graphics/sound.  This is okay.  I'm not blown away by the details of anything out there, except for the character generation of course, but I've also seen much worst.  The sounds are okay and I find it a joy to hear a lot of sounds from the Star Wars universe.  But from a game sponsored by Lucas and written by Sony, I would expect more in both categories.<br /><br />3)  The $15 per month to play.  Yes, you need to pay to play MMORPG's but I would expect much more for the $15 I'm spending.  I would be more than happy to pay it if I was getting my money's worth.  I don't feel I am, however because there is very little variety in game playing and questing.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />1)  Lag.  If you are around others or have just entered a town, the lag is unbelievable.  It is hard to imagine some people play this on dial-up.  I get a lot of lag for a high speed connection to the game.<br /><br />2)  Grinding for experience.  Sometimes you need to do something again and again and again to build experience in a certain profession.  If you want to be an artisan/crafter be prepared to make a lot of something that ends up getting destroyed and never used.  Prepare to make it again and again and again and again.....  This can be very boring.  Almost every profession requires something boring like this.  The only exciting one I've found is being a marksman or brawler where you get experience points for fighting and even then this is rather boring.  See #4 before.  For $15 a month, I'd expect more.  It would be nice if there was tasks you could take on for some professions to help build the experience and add variety to the game.<br /><br />3)  This is a resource HOG!!!  Half a Gig of memory and 4GB of hard drive space?!?!?!  Come on!!!  With this type of demand on my system I would expect much more.<br /><br />4)  Same-ol' bad guys.  Okay, I do quest after quest and they are all almost the same.  I fight the same small band of bad-guys, get my reward, and then repeat.  There is not much in the ways of getting different quests to perform.<br /><br />5)  Can only have one character per server.  This is the reason I'm not going to play anymore.  I wish I could build many characters on one server so I can still play with my group of friends.  I would like to have one character with a certain skill set and be able to swap him out for another character with other specialties for a certain quest.  However, each character you create has to play on different servers.<br /><br />So, if you like Star Wars, give this a go.  You might find it addicting to.

I feel it shouldn't. The sound was crystal clear . My current Sony headset has an option to increase sound or chat.(awesome feature) The mute/power button is on the big blue ear piece. You just hold the big blue ear piece and it turns on. To mute , you just click once. The mute turns the earpiece red when muted, but you cant see the red if you have the headset on.  The sony headset shows a mute icon on the screen when you do that, this pdp headset does not show me when its muted, so to find out if i muted the mic i have keep asking everyone if they can hear me. Now, the big reason i disliked the headset was when turning it off. I turn off the headset and now i have no sound on my tv(if completely wireless). WTF is this? I had to go in the playstation sound settings and change the audio to hear my tv, or i could just remove the USB dongle from the ps4. the Sony headset turns off and on, not affecting the sound on the tv. I turn if off and the tv turns on. I dont have to go into any settings to fix the sound. The great thing about the Afterglow is i can have the headset at any angle and still get that clear chat. My sony headset has to stay upright for the chat to sound clear due to the sonys not having a mic. I am not sure if I'm doing anything wrong or if that is the way the headset is set up.

Ive played every mission on its hardest difficulty.This game is well polished overall , but it has its flaws. First off the load times are ridiculous. The communication is horrible. Other than me starting a chat party with people i already know, its hard to find people that will want to do exactly what you want to do.Yes you can do missions alone, but for a MMO, id like to play with random people. There needs to be a matchmaking room to allow this. The AI's take cover well and move toward you to attack, however you can run away and just regenerate, rinse and repeat. All enemies for the most part are bullet sponges. Its just too easy.The one thing that gets most people is they expected way to much out of this game. They marketed the hell out of this game to make it seem EPIC. Its not EPIC. Dont get me wrong im enjoying the game and getting my moneys worth out of it, but i wont be playing this game within a month. The storyline is non existant, the grinding is ridiculous and the 3 characters you choose from are pretty much the same. The guns are not really different from the next, upgrading is boring and the game is just redundant. I found myself in the same areas doing the same thing over and over. I went into MP and had  great time playing it. Not sure if it was balanced correctly, but you are allowed to take your weapons into MP. I enjoyed the MP, and strikes the most so far.

Also Ellie uses these \"f\" word in almost every sentence. i have nothing against cussing but dang its just way overused. its more annoying than anything. The AI is really good at fighting and hiding, but on one scene , the ai was hiding getting ready for the next battle and an enemy walked by her . in the battle i was suppose to kill one enemy while the ai killed the other one simulataneously. the enemy had not engage because i was still looking for items before i started the next battle/scene. so as i kill the next enemy , the ai's enemy walks by and then she gets killed from behind. so these are no biggies,but it was noticeable.

Great story line, great acting,good comedy, and awesome zombies and fighting. the game has great stealth. most of all it has a sense of realism. when playing you can kinda imagine how it would be if something like this really happened. low food, health kits, ammo etc. (if playing  on hard) playing on easy is a different story. gamers say this game is not great etc, i have seen it before its nothing new.. but what makes this game pretty damn good is has all these elements that i just mentioned , other than the glitches., its one of my favorite games that i have enjoyed playing.

Then Metro last light comes out. Im excited to pick off where i left off.Now im only a quarter of the way through Last Light. Its not one of those games that i play and cant put down. So i buy the game on release date. I put it in the coming Saturday and im ready to beat it in one day..NOPE! im on the train at the beginning and im walking from front to back to check for items and im hopping around messing with the buttons. Then i find myself on the outside of the train while its moving.I somehow went through the window. It stops and its time to get off. IM STUCK NOW! im able to walk back and forth on the side of the train but cant get back in to get off on the other side. I have to restart! so i then turn the game off and come back to it a day later.Just a glitch, no biggie.Does not really bother me that kind of stuff happens. So now im back to playing. I like close combat with the shotty. Im blasting guys left and right and find that the shotgun is so strong that it knocks them through the wall if they are standing near it whether its brick or steel. WHAT A SHOTGUN! Sometimes they disappear into the wall or half their leg is sticking out shaking. Its still not enough to say its a crap game.The game is well made, its fun, has eerie moments. Another thing i noticed is when i go from place to place, the NPC characters say my name quite often when addressing me, which is fine and all, but i just barely met them and have not told them my name.Now i do know that some know who i am, but isolated areas do not. Not a biggie but something i noticed. Graphics are pretty good, but not great. Overall, im satisfied with the game, but could have waited for a price drop. right now id give the game a 8/10. Edit: 5/25: so I've been playing about an hour a day since my last review. Still not able to finish due to some slight frustration. Lets start off with it being a bit repetitive. Almost all games are like that. Going from place to place etc, but that's not the reason for the frustration. From time to time I die and the game auto saves. So when I die and get ready to restart the game just keeps showing me dying and I can't continue. So I have to restart the level. This has happened to me about 4 times. That causes me to stop playing  and forces me to play black ops 2. Ill just come back to metro when I start raging at the quick scopers which will be soon enough!

In contrast, when I played SONY's ping pong, it was NOTHING like my real ping pong table at home (if I swung that hard in real life, the ball would not land on the table, it would be on the neighbor's roof!) -- I was very disappointed.  Sony MOVE also doesn't track my legs unlike Kinect which tracked my leg kicking a ball.  Kinect also saw the difference between my bicep and forearm movements.<br /><br />With the Kinect, I don't have to worry about the kids breaking the controllers, recharging batteries, or finding the damn controllers when the kids don't put back where I can find them!<br /><br />For a fighting game for adults, you gotta check out youtube's MMA title called \"FIGHTERS UNCAGED for Xbox 360\" which not only detects your punches but also detects your kicks (which SONY MOVE can't).  Now that's a workout for me to get off my butt!<br /><br />I hope SONY corrects its serious mistake with the MOVE and buy the Kinect technology.  Pretty sad that SONY isn't on the cutting edge of innovative products anymore.  I love Sony products, I only buy SONY TVs, clock radios, boom boxes, portable DVD players.  In the sound department, I usually buy other brands though like Denon, Onkyo, Yamaha, Harmon Kardon.<br /><br />Maybe SONY and Microsoft can make a deal: I'll give you blu-ray if you give me Kinect then it'll be a win-win for consumers and game makers!<br /><br />For fitness, I bought EA Sports Active 2 for SONY PS3 which is a better motion controller than the MOVE for tracking your body because it allows your hands to be free and it tracks your leg and it is also a heart rate monitor.  I hope future games will use the motion controller in EA Sports Active rather than the MOVE to track whole body like Microsoft Xbox Kinect.<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: I wish Sony would make more family friendly games instead of mostly violent games for hardcore gamers like 1st-person bloody shootouts and driving games.  I wish Sony made a version of Microsoft's Kinect Adventure (river rush) game -- that's an awesome game for the family.  Maybe some fun educational games too.<br /><br />If Sony doesn't add family-oriented games and Sony PS3 dies, at least I still have a blu-ray player.<br />Look at how many family games there are for Xbox: [...]<br /><br />I think Sony targets core gamers. However, core gamers (not me) don't really want a motion controller.  In contrast, Microsoft Kinect is targeting the mainstream audience (my family and I). I experienced the Microsoft Kinect at a kid's Jump/bounce kind of place and let me tell you, this kind of exposure is going to kill SONY MOVE because moms/dads spread the word like wildfire!  How did you think the Wii got to be #1 with families?<br /><br />I want to exercise more but my treadmill/spinner are boring so I would buy the Kinect and I think City Parks&Rec Depts would too.  Additionally, I can see how corporations can buy this inexpensive video-conferencing device (it also follows subjects around the room automatically and resizes frames when more people enter the frame).  In all, SONY PS3 may stay around but this does not look good for SONY PS3 MOVE's future.  So, I've just mentioned 2 new markets that Kinect can open whereas SONY MOVE cannot.  1/14/2011 update: At Target I saw a few games available on both XBox and PS3 and the PS3 versions were about $10 cheaper so in these cases, I would still buy the PS3 version.<br /><br />Everytime I go to the store to buy a new game, I don't see any new Amazon highly-rated family games and am disappointed.  Maybe I have to bite the bullet and buy a Microsoft XBox 360 after all in order to get the family, sports, and exercise games for the whole family to enjoy but I haven't decided until now after I've experienced the Kinect.  If I do buy the Xbox, any new games that are available on both PS3 and Xbox platforms, I'll probably buy Xbox versions because there's a higher chance that Xbox gaming will be around longer than the PS3, which also makes my trade-ins more valuable.  1/14<br /><br />TO SONY (if you're reading this), I am VERY interested in motion gaming but with family games, not inappropriate 1st-person-shoot-bloody-gory games for my kids or me.  Make more family-oriented games because I will buy.  I own the following and I highly recommend these family games:<br /><br />- GRAN TURISMO 5<br />- EA Sports Active 2 (with motion devices)<br />- TEST DRIVE UNLIMITED 2<br />- NCAA Football 11<br />- MADDEN 10 FOOTBALL<br />- VANCOUVER 2010<br />- FIFA SOCCER 10<br />- LITTLE BIG PLANET<br />- GRID<br />- G-FORCE<br />- CARS<br />- VIRTUAL TENNIS 3<br />- SURF'S UP<br />- WAKEBOARD (ONLINE PURCHASE)<br />- TOY STORY 3<br />- BLADESTORM<br />- MONSTERS VS ALIENS<br />- RAPALA FISHING FRENZY 2009<br />- PINBALL HALL OF FAME - THE WILLIAMS COLLECTION<br />- NBA 2K10<br />- MLB 10 THE SHOW<br />- BLAZING ANGELS 2 (flying game)<br /><br />FOR ADULTS:<br />- 007 QUANTUM OF SOLACE<br />- MOTOR STORM PACIFIC RIFT<br /><br />=========================================<br />6/1/2011 update: I bought the XBox 250GB with Kinect and we love it!

{"UserID": "AF3IEBH5ARMPBOVEX7VFANWDYSBQ", "ReviewList": [{"Rating": 3.0, "Title": "Not ready for prime time but has some good points.", "Content": "As a child from the 80s, I grew up playing the original NES (Nintendo Entertainment System). I also spent plenty of time playing Atari and Intellivision games. While the graphics and audio are a far cry from what we have today, there is much to like about the old games. Such as them being simpler and less dizzying. I got this system mainly to play with my 13-year-old, but I also wanted to engage my non-gamer wife because she prefers the speed of older games. Unfortunately, there are problems with this system.<br /><br />The first issue is that you can’t turn it off. Once you put the batteries (not included) into the joystick controller(s), a red light turns on. And it stays on until you remove the batteries. There's no on/off switch. This is a very poor design as your non-rechargeable batteries will drain when not in use. Not only from the endless light, but I’m assuming there may be a wireless connectivity drain as well. The only solution is to constantly remove and reinstall the batteries, which is annoying, especially since the battery cover is held on with a screw (a clip would have been more efficient).<br /><br />The second issue is with the joystick. It’s not as responsive as expected. When playing games like Pac-Man and Dig Dug, I got frustrated with how often the characters would not move up or down. In some cases, I’d be moving them in a direction when they would suddenly stop (and that’s without me changing the pressure on the joystick). At first, I thought the issue was with me, but after trying different techniques and varying amounts of pressure, I found that it wasn’t. The problem is with the controllers. This makes many of the games unplayable unless you don’t mind your character dying from a lack of precise control.<br /><br />The third issue is that there isn’t a way to locate games quickly and easily. Sure, it’s broken up into sections, but a single section could contain over 300 games. To get through the list, you must scroll through one game at a time. This is time-consuming especially if you know what game you want to play. They should have added a search feature, such as an onscreen keyboard. A favorites section would have been helpful, too, where you could save your most frequently played games to access them more easily. But that is missing as well.<br /><br />The fourth issue is that the manual isn’t the most comprehensive, and some of the wording is confusing. It took me a while to figure out how to get back to the menu when in a game. At first, I thought I had to unplug the power from the HDMI unit, but thankfully you can press the start and selection keys at the same time to open a panel that lets you navigate back to the menu or to even save a game.<br /><br />The fifth issue is that some games can bog down. For instance, when playing Metroid there were several enemies on the screen at the same time, and suddenly the game started lagging. My guess is that the unit has a limited amount of random access memory.<br /><br />All that said, there are things I do like about this system, such as the ability to save games and return to them later. I had no issues with the controllers connecting to the HDMI unit, and the 1 and 2 player switches worked fine. I didn’t have any problems with the buttons; they responded well (it’s just the joystick that is unreliable). I also like the ability to load my own .nes ROMS. For instance, one of the old NES games I used to love playing is the 1987 version of Monopoly. While the system didn’t come with it, I was able to download a copy to the included TF card and it worked! Because that game is slow-paced, the imprecision of the joy sticks wasn’t as big a problem. That game was playable, and as such, the reason I gave this item 3 rather than 1 star.<br /><br />If you have similar slow-paced games you like, and you don't mind continually removing and inserting batteries, then maybe give this a shot. But if you like games with precision play, I recommend avoiding.<br /><br />Note: it says the expansion slot can handle a 32G card. I checked the one it comes with, and it showed me a 503.33MB capacity. All the included games didn’t even take up half the space, so there’s plenty of room left for more ROMs. (No need to purchase a 32G card, which would be overkill IMO.) Just note that to get ROMs on the card, you need a way to insert a microSD into your computer. The USB plug that goes into the HDMI device is only for powering the unit, not for plugging it into your computer to transfer files. Another thing to keep in mind is that all the games are on the card, so don’t lose it. Or make a backup. There’s only 1 game loaded on the HDMI unit that plays when the card is removed (F-22 flight game).", "ParentASIN": "B0C1GZ63X9", "Timestamp": 1676575810837, "ItemName": "Handheld Game Console, Plug and Play Wireless Video Retro Game Console HDMI Output TV Stick,2 Wireless Joysticks Controllers, Best Gifts Choice for Kids, Children,Adults", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 3.5, "RatingCount": 87, "Price": 49.99, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "Nintendo Systems", "Game Boy Systems", "Game Boy Advance", "Consoles"], "Description": "The wireless TV game console features over 800 built-in retro games, requiring no downloads or internet connection.

Add the cool lighting effects on both the earcups and cat-ears and you have a perfect gift for this age group. She’s more of a casual gamer, playing games like Roblox, Minecraft, and Genshin Impact. She chats with her friends while gaming and sometimes listens to music. For all these things, this headset gets the job done.<br /><br />That said, I’m more of an intense gamer and have owned and used gaming headsets from Bose, Razer, SteelSeries, Turtle Beach, and HyperX among a list of generic models. These Cat Ear Headphones perform more like a generic model than those aforementioned brand names.<br /><br />Here’s a breakdown of my observations:<br /><br />1) On the computer, there is no software for controlling features or sound settings like there is with known brands like Razer. The only sound control you have is a button on the headset that toggles between 3 modes: gaming, music and live. As such, they also lack more advanced settings like volume normalization, ambient noise reduction, vocal clarity, and game-chat balance.<br /><br />2) There isn’t much bass, even in music mode. Since there’s no software, there’s no Audio Equalizer. I tested using a third-party EQ on my computer. Making tweaks can increase the bass in music mode, but even then, the bass is minor. Turning it up too much makes the speakers flub—as in, sound horrible and wrecked. The speakers can’t handle significant bass increases. The treble is decent, though. For FPS games, you don’t want a lot of bass anyway. But it is a bit of a letdown for music listeners.<br /><br />3) This headset only has a USB connector. No 3.5mm Stereo Plug. Which means you can’t plug them into a PS4 or PS5 controller. You must plug them into the console itself. This brings up the issue of distance and cord length. I measured the cord length at approximately 6’ 10” (six feet ten inches), which isn’t long enough to stretch from the average media center to seating area. Unless you lay on your floor near your console or use a Rocker Gaming Chair. That said, the distance works well when plugging into a computer tower at a desk. So really depends on how you use it.<br /><br />4) Overall comfortable. Lots of padding in the headband and earcups. Because they go over and around the outside of your ears (rather than on or in), there’s no pressure or discomfort against your ears. Plus, this provides some noise blockage. The noise blocking isn’t noise canceling (NC/ANC), it’s more similar to the type of blocking you’d get from earmuffs. Since they are closed-back headphones there’s not as much sound leakage coming in or going out.<br /><br />5) While comfortable, I do find them to be on the heavy side. I weighed them (with mic and cord) at 392 grams. This is heavy when compared with other options. For instance, my Bose gaming headset is 237 grams, HyperX Cloud II = 318g, and HyperXCloud Stinger Core = 243g. And those all have batteries for added weight. My SteelSeries Siberia P100 without a battery weighs 211g and is my console headset of choice (even though it’s older). The closest similarity to the weight that I came across is that of my Razer Kraken TE, which I weighed at 360g. Overall, these GS510 are on the heavy side, but it makes sense in that they have extra plastic on them due to the glowing kitty ears.<br /><br />6) I tested the headphones on my PS5, Windows 10 PC, and iMac (macOS Catalina). In all instances, the headphones were recognized and worked fine with plug and play (PnP). You just need to select them from your audio devices (showed up as SOMIC STINCOO GS510). So, no need to download drivers. This is good because the itsomic site doesn’t have drivers for these specific headphones. It uses your OS.<br /><br />### Conclusion ###<br /><br />My daughter would give them a 5-star rating, but I’m pickier. The lack of software control, inability to plug into a PlayStation controller, low bass for music, and heavy weight has me rating them closer to 3-stars. That said, they perform well enough at this price range, plus they have a cuteness factor other headphones do not. So, for argument’s sake, I’m combining our ratings together into 4-stars. Great gift for tweens and teens who are casual gamers, but intense gamers and heavy music listeners are better off looking elsewhere.", "ParentASIN": "B09N6H2B17", "Timestamp": 1642455399350, "ItemName": "EASARS Wireless Cat Ear Headphones, Pink Gaming Headset Bluetooth 5.0 for Smartphone, Retractable Mic, 50mm Drivers, RGB Lighting Headset with Mic (USB Dongle Not Included)", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.3, "RatingCount": 738, "Price": 69.99, "Categories": ["Video Games", "PC", "Accessories", "Headsets"], "Description": "The wireless headset features Bluetooth 5.0 for quick connections up to 10m and includes a 3.5mm cable for wired use.

The sound quality is more middling and appropriate for this price range. Can sound a little muffled or muddy at times—but that’s more a disadvantage for music than gaming. The bass is softer than I personally like and is more punchy than rumbly (not very deep). Which is also better for gaming than music since it softens explosions. The treble isn’t as crisp as I like but is sharp enough to hear footsteps. As I said, it’s a good middling sound meant more for gaming than music. If you use these on a PC, you can use a third-party equalizer to help adjust the sound. But because these plug in via 3.5mm jack there’s no software support from Turtle Beach like there is with their USB headsets. That’s to be expected; these are designed for consoles.<br /><br />Note: the sound is better when worn without eyeglasses. While you can use this headset when wearing glasses, there’s a good deal of sound leakage from the earcups at the temples and thus quality loss. Especially in the bass. Thankfully using glasses (whether prescription, gaming, or blue-blocking) doesn’t detract from the comfort. The headset fits loosely so there’s no pressure put against the temples. But you sacrifice already middling sound quality.<br /><br />It’s an attractive-looking headset with a thick, soft cushion for your ears and padding on the headband. While comfortable, as mentioned, they fit loosely and don’t hold securely to the head. When shaking my head from left to right, the headset flopped around and came out of position. When nodding up and down, they came forward and fell off. This is bad if you want to move around a lot, but fine if you mostly sit still.<br /><br />I do find them on the heavy side. I weighed them (with mic and cord) at 362 grams. Considering there’s no battery, this is heavy when compared with other options. For instance, my Bose gaming headset is 237 grams, HyperX Cloud II = 318g, and HyperXCloud Stinger Core = 243g. And those all have batteries for added weight. My SteelSeries Siberia P100 without a battery weighs 211g and is my console headset of choice (even though it’s older). The closest similarity to the weight that I came across is that of my Razer Kraken TE, which I weighed at 360g. Overall, these Turtle Beach Recon 500 are on the heavy side.<br /><br />I measured the cord at approximately 4-feet 5-inches (53”). It’s a bit of an odd length for console as it’s too short for connecting to an entertainment center, but overkill for connecting to a controller. While connecting to a controller is what I recommend this headset for, there’s extra cable slop laying loose and can get in the way. Honestly, it’s a better length for using with a gaming laptop. Also, one negative is that you can’t unplug the cord from the headset to change out with a different length. It’s permanently attached.<br /><br />Having the volume on the headset is a nice feature, especially when attaching to a console controller. Gives you the ability to adjust the level with your thumb rather than having to navigate the settings menu. And having a mic mute is nice too, although since these are not powered, there are no lights to let you know if it’s muted or not. That said, once you get used to the feel of the button, you can tell whether it’s pressed in or not without looking. All these controls are on the headset itself, not the cord.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a decent gaming headset for consoles. I’ve used it with my PS5 and find it works just fine with it. I also tested on PC, iMac, Lenovo Chromebook, and music player. Definitely worked best on console and for gaming over music, but music was decent at middling quality (some songs sound better than others). I wish they were lighter, fit more snugly, and worked better with eyeglasses. As such, I’d lower the star rating to 3 if they were more expensive. But I think they’re appropriately priced for what you get.", "ParentASIN": "B094B42RCJ", "Timestamp": 1626989351253, "ItemName": "Turtle Beach Recon 500 Multiplatform Gaming Headset for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Mobile, & PC with 3.5mm - 60mm Dual Drivers, Memory Foam - Black", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.5, "RatingCount": 3102, "Price": 72.06, "Categories": ["Video Games", "PlayStation 4", "Accessories", "Headsets"], "Description": "The Turtle Beach headset features 60mm Eclipse dual drivers, a precision-engineered earcup design, a pro-level TruSpeak microphone, athletic fabric-wrapped memory foam ear cushions, a durable metal-reinforced headband, ProSpecs glasses-friendly design, and convenient on-ear controls."}, {"Rating": 4.0, "Title": "Comfortable, lightweight, great battery life, good for music but a bit “boomy” for gaming.", "Content": "Pros:<br />- Comfortable and lightweight<br />- Can wear for hours without discomfort<br />- Works well with eyeglasses<br />- Can be used while charging w/cable<br />- Can mute mic from earpiece<br />- Great battery life<br />- USB-C charging<br />- Good for music<br /><br />Cons:<br />- No EQ to adjust bass on PC<br />- No game-chat balance<br />- Mic isn’t retractable<br />- Mic cover muffles voice<br />- No 7.1 button on headset<br />- Headband gets greasy looking<br />- No lighting effects<br />- Limited, poorly rated PC software<br /><br />This is the 4th HyberX headset I’ve tested and used. The others were: HyperX Cloud Flight S, HyperX Cloud Revolver, and HyperX Cloud Stinger Core. Out of all four, I like this second best to the HyperX Cloud Flight S. I mainly use these headsets on PC, but I have tested them on the PS4 and PS5, which the Cloud II works well on.<br /><br />While these Cloud II are slightly lighter, and IMO more comfortable than the Cloud Flight S, they aren’t as good for PC gaming due to (1) lack of game-chat balance, (2) inability to lower the bass, and (3) can’t toggle 7.1 from the headset. They are, however, better for music and have the newer USB-C charging instead of Micro-USB.<br /><br />The NGenuity software is still in beta (as of this review, March 2021) and only rated 1.5 stars out of 5 by over 200 users in the Microsoft Store. One reason for the lower rating is the lack of an equalizer. You can’t lower the amount of bass without using third-party options. While bass is great for music, it can be distracting while gaming. Particularly in FPS. Overpowering explosions and “boomy” gunshots make detecting enemy footsteps more difficult, plus can give you a headache over time. On my other headset, the Cloud Flight S, when you engage 7.1 mode, there’s next to no bass at all. At first, I didn’t like how flat it sounded, but after a while I found it improved my game awareness and I much preferred it. I wish that was the same for these Cloud II. If only NGenuity included an EQ like Razer Synapse 3 and SteelSeries Engine 3 I’d rate this headset 5-stars instead of 4.<br /><br />As mentioned, I love how comfortable this Cloud II headset is. I’ve worn it for more than 4 hours of gaming and didn’t have any discomfort. I weighed them in at 318g, which is pretty light considering they contain a battery*. The padding on the earcups and headband is comfortable and soft and allows for eyeglasses to be worn without adding unwanted pressure to the temples. The headset holds tight enough so that it doesn’t slip off when looking down or turning your head from side to side, but not so tight that it adds too much pressure to the sides of your head. It is perfectly balanced.<br /><br />* The battery lasts a pleasantly long time, and you can use the headset while charging if needed.<br /><br />I’m surprised there’s no game-chat balance since that seems more like a software ability than hardware. Why HyberX included that on the Cloud Flight S but not the Cloud II is beyond me. I find this is a useful feature when playing older games like UT3 that blasts sounds (even on the lowest setting) so loudly that you can’t clearly hear your teammates. It’s not a problem for all games, just specific ones. I personally find the ability to force the game volume down and increase the chat volume to be extremely useful in these situations. That's missing on these.<br /><br />Another complaint is that the mic doesn’t retract. If you aren’t using it and don’t want the mic hanging off the headset, you have to unplug it and try not to lose it. This headset comes with a foam cover for the tip. When I used it, my gaming buddy said it sounded like I was talking through a sock. So, I removed it and found the mic worked better without.<br /><br />### Conclusion ###<br /><br />Overall, my complaints are fairly minor. I’ve used this headset for a few months and they’re in my top-5 favorites, if only because they are so comfortable and have such a good battery life. Just wanted you to be aware of the pluses and minuses before buying. I do hope someday HyberX improves their software and allows more customization for adjusting bass and treble.

It was no less impressive when I unboxed it and plugged it in for the first time. It’s visually impressive. The ROCCAT Swarm software which drives this keyboard has some unique light settings that you don’t see with Razer, Logitech, SteelSeries, HyperX, etc. Such as the snake lighting. I also really like the ability to change the colors of specific keys based on what software/game is loaded.<br /><br />That’s where the software excels. It falls short in so many other areas. For instance, when playing Overwatch, I need my CTRL key remapped to the Caps Lock (it’s much easier for my pinky to reach). But Swarm won’t let you remap the Caps Lock. I got frustrated trying to mess with it and finally wrote support, who confirmed this is true. I also asked support if there was any sort of guide or tutorial to using Swarm. There isn’t, which is a really bad business practice. Especially since the software is so confusing. I ended up having to download and write a script for AutoHotkey to do what Swarm should have.<br /><br />I was also disappointed by the media keys. There’s no play/pause button and no previous/next. Just a mute and volume knob. You can hold down the FN button and then press F9, F11, or F12 to get those functions, but it requires two button presses, which is more cumbersome. No quick feel and press. You gotta look down and coordinate your fingers with the keys. The media controls are way better, and more complete, on my HyperX Alloy Elite 2 and Razer Huntsman Elite.<br /><br />Thankfully, the keystrokes are responsive and work well for gaming. They are quieter than the keys on the Razer Huntsman Elite, but still make a ticking noise that can be heard in your mic. It’s about the same loudness as the HyperX Alloy Elite 2. But there’s a slight echo of the springs after each keypress that lasts about a second. You have to be close to hear it, so it’s not a huge deal to me. Especially since I usually have a gaming headset on. A user on reddit pointed it out and I can confirm it’s there, so is something that can annoy some users. The Razer Huntsman Elite also has a slight spring echo, but the HyperX Alloy Elite 2 does not.<br /><br />I like the wrist wrest. While it’s not very high (flatter and closer to the desk than others), I like that it’s plastic so it won’t wear out like cloth or imitation leather. Although it gets greasy looking.<br /><br />The keycaps feel like they are ABS, which is the cheapest and most common plastic used for keycaps. They have a smooth texture, which is nice to glide your fingers across but can wear out and become greasy/shiny over time. I personally prefer PBT keycaps for the higher quality, textured feel. It’s pretty common, even for elite keyboards, to come with ABS so many gamers (myself included) purchase PBT keycaps to swap out with specific keys (mainly the W,A,S,D,X). But unfortunately, you can’t do that with this keyboard. Not only was I unable to find PBT on ROCCAT’s site, but third-party replacement keys on Amazon won’t work. Why? Because they are the wrong size. ROCCAT used custom keycaps on this keyboard, which are flatter and skinnier than standard size keys. So if you put a PBT on here, the key will stick up. The only way you can get PBT on this keyboard is to swap all the keys out, thus making them the same height. But then you lose the cool lighting which is what makes this keyboard cool to begin with.<br /><br />In conclusion, I love the lighting and the keystrokes are great. But limited software, sparse media controls, and inability to add individual PBT keycaps is a huge drawback for me. Especially when compared with other keyboards in this price range. I went back to my HyperX Alloy Elite 2, which is my favorite keyboard to date but am still looking for the perfect one.

Shape feels good in my hand, with nice subtle curves in the buttons. Button clicking is responsive and good for games where you need to rapidly click them. Sensor is pretty good, tracks pixel by pixel, and is responsive even with small movements (good for sniping). Slides smoothly with little resistance on my mousepad. The shell feels tough and durable even with the honeycomb holes—I can press against it and it holds solid, not flexing or bending.<br /><br />The problems I have with the honeycomb holes are: (1) There are holes on the mouse buttons, and I find my pointer finger rubs against them. After a time, my finger starts to hurt and sometimes even shows a mark where the holes pressed against it. People who use a claw grip won’t have this problem, but I tend to keep my fingers flatter and sometimes higher up, so it does affect me. (2) If you eat at your desk, there’s a good chance you’ll get crumbs inside the mouse. You also have to be extra careful with fluids. You can’t simply open up the mouse without removing parts of the bottom (+ voids warranty?), so it’s a little difficult to clean. Even dust build-up can be an issue. You can blow it out using canned air, but chunkier items could get stuck. Best if you keep your hands and desk clean when using this mouse.<br /><br />The sides don’t have rubbery grips. It’s hard plastic with a slight texture added. I personally like not having rubber grips because the sticky undercoating releases over time and the grips come off. You don’t have to worry about that with this mouse. But at the same time, because the sides are plastic, they don’t provide as much friction and are slipperier. This isn’t a problem for me because my grip is naturally tight. There is grip tape included for those who hold the mouse softly, but I’m personally not a fan of tape where the adhesive can wear out and cause the tape to shift out of place. I’ve stopped buying Razer mice because of this; the rubbery texture on the sides of every single mouse I’ve had from them got loose and peeled up. (And going through warrantee with Razer is like pulling fingernails, and also temporary since it just happens again.) So, personally, I love that the sides are plastic and not rubber.<br /><br />This mouse uses the NGenuity software to control/tweak dpi and button settings. Such as setting it up to autoload different dpi depending on what game loads. Keep in mind the software is still in beta so can be buggy at times and has limited options.

I find that NGenuity works well enough for basic mouse settings.<br /><br />Other notes are that there’s no right-side buttons and the only lighting is on the scroll wheel.<br /><br />In conclusion, I’d have rated this mouse 5-stars were it not for the uncomfortable honeycomb holes in the mouse buttons. With intense gaming for hours at a time, my finger wasn’t happy. I’m sticking to the G Pro X Superlight as my favorite mouse. But for the price, HyperX Pulsefire Haste is a great lightweight option.

It’s at best a $50 headset, not $150. Way overpriced. Here’s why:<br /><br />1) It’s heavy. I weighed it at nearly 400g, which is heavier than my other headsets. Including the HyperX Cloud Flight S and HyperX Cloud II Wireless. That’s crazy considering those contain batteries so in theory should be heavier, right? Nope. And that’s not including the weight of the USB audio control mixer which hangs off the cable.<br /><br />2) The suspension headband is flawed. It has extraordinarily little tension and isn’t strong enough to support the weight of the earcups. As such, when I put the headset on, the headband pushes all the way against the frame, causing the earcups to go further down than is comfortable. I constantly find myself trying to re-adjust only for it to move back down.<br /><br />3) It’s not comfortable. After a few hours of gameplay, I found my ears were hurting.<br /><br />4) If you shake your head from side to side, the headset jumps around. And if you look down, the headband falls slightly forward. It doesn’t hold solidly like other HyperX headsets I’ve had.<br /><br />5) The NGenuity software does not recognize the headset nor the USB audio control mixer. Meaning, there’s no software support or tweaks to be had. No game-chat balance. No mic monitoring. No turning the 7.1 surround sound on/off thru software. You can only minimally control it through the attached USB audio control mixer.<br /><br />6) The sound quality is subpar. If you want to use these to listen to music, you’ll be disappointed. The treble is muffled/dull (not crisp) and the bass is mediocre. That’s when in standard mode. When in 7.1 mode, the treble is a little cleaner, but the bass mostly goes away (which is good for gaming, not music). There’s no equalizer to tweak this to get better sound quality. Not without using third-party software.<br /><br />7) There’s no mic mute on the headset itself. Only on the USB audio control mixer. So, if you use this headset without the mixer (such as a console), you can’t mute it. Plus reaching down the cord to press the mute on/off can be challenging without looking (eyes on the game).<br /><br />8) The USB audio control mixer has a clip on it as if designed to attach to clothing. There’s no good way to attach it to your desk. As such, it slides around and often hangs down adding more weight to the cord. It’s really limited when comparing with the 7.1 USB Audio Controller that comes with the Razer Kraken Tournament Edition. Not only does that have game-mic balance, bass control, and can be customized and controlled by software (for additional features like mic sensitivity, sidetone, and EQ) but is less expensive.<br /><br />That said, it’s not all bad. I found that the 7.1 mode, while playing FPS, worked decently. I was able to clearly hear the positioning of footsteps. And because there isn’t much bass in 7.1 mode, the sound of guns and explosions wasn’t overwhelming. I had considered using the 7.1 USB audio control mixer with a more comfortable headset, but it’s still not anywhere near as good as Razer’s 7.1 USB Audio Controller. (Right now, my ideal setup is to use Razer's 7.1 controller with the Bose gaming headset).<br /><br />In summary. This headset isn’t comfortable and is too limited.

It felt a bit too rounded. Especially on the Left and Right Click buttons. I was used to mice like the Razer DeathAdder Elite, Razer Mamba Elite, and HyperX Pulsefire Core which have more definition to the shape and design. For the price of the G PRO X Superlight, it looks plain and unimpressive. In fact, it “looks” cheaply made and low-end.<br /><br />That said, I quickly became accustomed to the rounded shape and found it didn’t bother me at all. My grip feels comfortable and it doesn’t cause any added hand soreness. If anything, the shape has improved my comfort level.<br /><br />The size is more on the medium range. Smaller than my Logitech G403, and much lighter. I have long fingers and a large hand but don’t have any problems using this mouse.<br /><br />When I first looked into the G PRO X Superlight, I was shocked to find that Rocket Jump Ninja has it ranked as his #1 mouse (as of this review: January 2021). That’s saying a lot considering he has 40 on his list of “Top Mice.” What’s more surprising is that I’ve come to agree with him. This has become my new favorite mouse.<br /><br />As I said, it doesn’t look impressive. There are no fancy lights (just a charging light) or buttons on the right-side. There isn’t even a DPI button. But that’s on purpose. Logitech stripped this mouse down to the very basics for the sake of cutting the weight to 60g. And that’s impressive considering this is a wireless mouse that has a battery. I didn’t expect to like the lightweight factor as much as I do. But it helped improve my aim and thus, helped me win more games.<br /><br />I find that the response time is just as good as a wired mouse. There are no delays or hesitation, and there is pinpoint accuracy. The mouse movements and button clicks are perfect. Works great for snipers.<br /><br />I listed “No built-in textured grips” as a con, but it can also be considered a positive. It’s the reason I won’t buy Razer mice any more. The rubbery texture on the sides of every single mouse I’ve had from them got loose and peeled up. Apparently, I grip the mouse too tightly with my fingers when playing and the sticky undercoating releases over time. I’ve tried repairing myself, but this only works temporally. And going through warrantee with Razer is like pulling fingernails, and also temporary since it just happens again. But that’s a long story, and not relevant here. The point is that the G PRO Superlight doesn’t have any textured grips attached. You just have a smooth plastic surface. The con with this is that your fingers have a higher chance of sliding around. To counter this, Logitech included textured stickers that can be added, but this isn’t a great option. No way those stickers are going to last for the life of the mouse. Plus, they just go on the surface of the mouse, not inset like Razer, so the chances of them moving out of place is higher. While I do wish there was a built-in (not a sticker, but part of the mouse itself) rubbery grip like there is on the G403, I haven’t had gripping issues without it. That is in part due to the mouse being so light, and part because I have a tight grip by nature. It really depends on your own personal use.<br /><br />To correctly set up this mouse, you’ll need to download and install the G Hub software. While I have mixed feelings about the software (can be buggy and isn’t super user-friendly), it does work well enough for the most part. It can be a little slow loading the settings on boot, delaying the correct DPI settings. And not having a DPI button means you are dependent on the software to switch. (Although, you can manipulate this using G-Shift.) Thankfully you can have the software auto-load different DPI settings depending on what game is launched. What I like best about the software is that it works on macOS (unlike HyperX NGenuity and Razer Synapse 3). I don’t do a lot of gaming on macOS, but I do use it for graphic design work, and this mouse works great for that.<br /><br />Overall, the mouse looks cheap, but there’s nothing cheap about it. It’s high-end quality parts with flawless response time. It’s amazing how long the battery lasts considering how lightweight the mouse is. If you are into FPS games like me and have the budget for it, seriously give this mouse a try.

So, I won’t get too much into the details of the headset and focus more on the new gaming add-on (which was released less than a month ago: October 2020).<br /><br />This isn’t Bose’s first gaming headset, so shouldn’t be confused with the A20 Aviation released back in 2015. Part of what makes the QuietComfort 35 II unique is that it comes with digital noise canceling, which gaming headsets typically don’t have. To block outside noises, you would look toward headsets like the ones made by David Clark that have passive and Electronic Noise Cancelling, used for Esports and aviation. Bose took this approach with their iconic noise canceling feature and combined it with a portable option for music and a PC plugin for computer gaming.<br /><br />The idea has potential, and as a music headset, the QuietComfort 35 II is great. As a gaming headset, the noise canceling is great. But, unfortunately, it falls short in customization when comparing with Razer, HyperX and SteelSeries. All of which I’ve owned gaming headsets for.<br /><br />The main reason for this is that Bose doesn’t have a hardware or software configuration tool. While they do for mobile devices in the form of the Bose Connect app, they don’t have anything for your PC. Instead, the headset uses the default operating system’s audio software, which is really, really limited.<br /><br />This is fine for PS4 gaming, but not so much for PC.<br /><br />### Audio limitations ###<br /><br />For instance, you are stuck with stereo sound. As many gamers know, this is bad for games where listening for the enemy position is important. Such as enemy footsteps and gunshots in FPS. In comparison, my HyperX Cloud Flight S has 7.1 Surround Sound and my Razer Kraken uses THX 7.1. Both work well for Spatial Audio. Not so for the Bose.<br /><br />Another issue with not having configuration software is that you can’t adjust the amount of bass or treble. In some games, you want little to no bass . . . otherwise explosions may overwhelm enemy position. And enhanced treble can help clarify specific noises you want to watch out for. In other words, there’s no equalizer for the QuietComfort 35 II. Not unless you look to third-party solutions.<br /><br />### Mic limitations ###<br /><br />If these sound customizations were not enough of a setback, then consider the mic as well. (1) There’s no mic sensitivity setting, so it picks up unwanted noises. I found it picked up mouse clicks and mechanical keyboard presses. Also picks up the whooshing sound of my desk fan. Thus, you are forced to use push to talk unless you want to annoy your teammates. (2) There are no enhancements such as volume normalization, ambient noise reduction, and vocal clarity. (3) There is no game-chat balance that lets you increase chat volume and lower game volume for those instances where you are having a difficult time hearing your teammates.<br /><br />That said, the mic does have decent voice quality, though. My gaming buddy said I was easy to hear and understand.<br /><br />### Comfort ###<br /><br />This headset is really comfortable. Lighter than all my other gaming headsets. The headband has a soft, thick, cloth padding. The earcups have a leathery material that feels soft against my skin. Works well with my computer glasses, too. Doesn’t uncomfortably press the temples into my skin or ears, yet still has a tight seal to block outside noises. I’m able to wear this headset for hours without discomfort. That said, I did notice that heat can build up inside the earcups, causing sweat to form on my ears—depending on how active I am and how hot the temperature is around me.<br /><br />The headset stays on my head well without adding too much pressure. I’m able to raise and lower my head without it shifting, and it stays in place when violently shaking my head from side to side.<br /><br />### PC desktop controller ###<br /><br />The PC desktop controller comes with a nice, long cord. I measured it at 8-feet 3-inches (99”). The long cord is good for people who have their tower further away from their desk. When coupled with the length of the headset cord (which is 3-feet 9-inches), it offers plenty of length.<br /><br />There’s no adhesive like some other desktop controllers I’ve had, instead, it relies on weight and a rubbery bottom. I weighed it at 161.5 grams. The rubbery ring at the bottom adds a fair amount of friction as well as scratch resistance. With these things combined, I find the desktop controller stays in place pretty well. Unless you give it a good bump.<br /><br />The top of the controller is a large, analog dial. This makes raising and lowering the volume a simple and quick process. No having to hold down a button or press it several times. Speaking of buttons, there’s only one on the controller. This is used to activate mic monitoring. There are 3 preset volume settings for the mic monitoring: low, medium and high. While not as exact as what software would let you do, I find the volumes presets are just fine.<br /><br />There isn’t a mute button on the controller. I wish Bose would have programmed it so that pressing on the analog dial would act as a mute, but instead, they put the mute on the headphone cord.<br /><br />Note: I tested it on both Windows and macOS. It worked on both.<br /><br />### Noise Canceling ###<br /><br />I won’t get too much into the noise canceling since, as I said, this is a feature highly reviewed on the non-gaming version of the headset. But I will say it works pretty well, particularly for blocking voices. My cat will nag me when I’m gaming. With this headset on, I can see her mouth open and close, but not hear the meow. (Sorry kitty, gaming time.)<br /><br />But there’s one thing I didn’t think of. I couldn’t hear my own voice very well, either. When I was chatting in game, it felt odd not hearing myself clearly. I’ve never been one to use mic monitoring, but I do, now. Just so I have a sense of my own voice when calling out plays.<br /><br />### I got the headset to work better when using it with . . . ###<br /><br />I took the THX 7.1 USB Audio Controller that came with my Razer Kraken and plugged the Bose QuietComfort 35 II into it. Doing so got me around a lot of the limitations mentioned above. I now have surround sound, can control the game-chat balance, lower the bass, and access all the other features that come with the Razer Synapse 3 software. I like using the QuietComfort 35 II with the Razer THX Audio Controller much better than Bose’s controller, and the Bose headset is better than the Razer Kraken. I get the noise canceling, Bose quality speakers and mic, and comfort. To me, this is a win, but only comes as a hack of sorts.<br /><br />### Conclusion ###<br /><br />Unfortunately, since the headset is older, it uses the older Micro-USB plug for charging instead of the newer USB-C. Makes it feel a little dated but isn’t unforgivable. It also doesn’t come with a wall charger, so you have to use your own charging device (which is the new norm, unfortunately). The Bose QuietComfort 35 Series 2, when combined with the mic and PC desktop controller, makes for an interesting Gaming Headset. The good is the comfort and noise canceling, but bad is the lack of customizing software. As mentioned, there are ways around that. I just hope Bose invests resources in coming up with their own PC configuration tool someday.", "ParentASIN": "B08DVCNYJC", "Timestamp": 1604517655852, "ItemName": "Bose QuietComfort 35 Series 2 Gaming Headset — Comfortable Noise Cancelling Headphones Black", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.4, "RatingCount": 1487, "Price": null, "Categories": ["Video Games", "PC", "Accessories", "Headsets"], "Description": "The Bose QC35 II Gaming Headset is a versatile 2-in-1 device designed for both wired gaming and wireless lifestyle use.

There are two things I don’t like about this keyboard:<br /><br />1) Unlike the Alloy Elite 1, the 2 doesn’t come with a wrist wrest. Nor is there one specifically made for it as the 1 had. Some people might not need a wrist wrest, but I do. Partly due to the height I like my desk at, partly because my smartwatch band rubs the desk surface otherwise, and partly for comfort. I ended up purchasing the standard Wrist Rest that HyperX makes (ASIN: B07GP7JXQY). It’s not custom made for it but does fit the Alloy Elite 2 perfectly (width and height are spot on). It’s comfortable, too. But it does add an extra expense that the Alloy Elite 1 didn’t have.<br /><br />2) The keycaps are ABS, which are made with low quality plastic. The surface of the keys becomes shiny over time and can develop dents and wear. There is no texture on them either, making them more slippery. For the “Elite” category, I’d have much-preferred PBT keycaps. They are harder, more durable, and have texturing. The keys that come with the Alloy Elite 2 are specially designed to show more lighting, so it limits the options for replacement. I did come across some PBT keycaps made by Havit (ASIN: B07SGF9DTY) that look to match the same design, so will probably be upgrading to them in the future. Again, another added expense.<br /><br />Now, that’s what I don’t like. Pretty much everything else I can say about this keyboard is good. I found I prefer it over my Razer Huntsman Elite. In fact, since I got the Alloy Elite 2, my Razer Huntsman Elite has been collecting dust. That, too, came with ABS keycaps and I replaced them with PBT. I could put those PBT on the Alloy Elite 2, but they would hamper the lighting. Even though it’s a cosmetic feature, I personally like the lighting. It’s brighter and more vibrant than simply leaking out the bottom and coming thru the characters at the top. I will say that the Razer software has better lighting options and customization (even loads special lighting that synchronizes with certain games). But I was able to get the general look I like using the HyperX NGENUITY software.<br /><br />I also prefer the keyclicks better on the Alloy Elite 2. They respond just as well as the Razer Huntsman Elite but are quieter. As such they don’t get picked up in my mic as badly when chatting in-game. (Though, it is mechanical, which means there is some noise). The key presses feel softer and less “clicky” if that makes sense.<br /><br />As far as the HyperX NGENUITY software goes, you’ll notice it’s not rated the best. Compared with Razer Synapse, it’s more barebones. The most annoying part is that it stays open on your taskbar rather than minimizing to the notification area as Synapse does. That said, I got really frustrated with Razer Synapse to the point I’m slowing swapping out my devices to HyperX. It would constantly crash, forget my login, not load profiles correctly, and hijack my keysets even after I closed the game associated with them. While NGENUITY is more limited, it doesn’t give me any of those problems. I’m able to remap keys to specific games, which switch when the game loads and go back to normal when the game closes. Many of the settings save to the keyboard itself rather than a profile I have to log into. Although I do see a benefit to having a login, which I hope HyperX includes at some point. They don’t even have an online account to register your products, making getting support more difficult. As of now, NGENUITY is still in beta, so it's basic, but it works.<br /><br />The media controls work great and because I use the keyboard for things other than gaming, I like having the numpad. The keyboard is pretty heavy. I weighed it in at 3 pounds 1.7 ounces (with the cord plugged in), which is nearly a pound more than the Razer Huntsman Elite. The combination of the weight and rubber feet keep the keyboard from sliding around during rigorous gaming.<br /><br />### Conclusion ###<br /><br />The overall build quality of this keyboard looks and feels great. I love the lighting and the keypresses. I wish it came with a wrist wrest and better-quality keycaps, but I’m fine upgrading those things since the keyboard as a whole is nice.

There’s no mic sensitivity either, but that’s expected since NGENUITY doesn’t support that anyway. I was mostly disappointed that I couldn’t get the game-chat balance. This feature lets you turn the game volume down to better hear chat. Might not seem like a big deal, but some games—even at low volume—are too loud to hear chat clearly. So, the added feature is helpful for games like UT3 (yes, I still play that even though it’s older).<br /><br />What I like best about this Stinger Core headset is the comfort level. Being lightweight is a plus. I weighed it at 242.6 grams, which is 77.2 grams lighter than my HyperX Cloud FlightS. The earcups are lined with a heavily padded, soft material (foam-like rather than leather), which feels great against the sides of my head. I was able to wear computer glasses without any discomfort (no pressure against the temples of the glasses). I wore the headset for four hours and didn’t have any soreness (like I sometimes do from my FlightS). The only negative about the liner used on the earcups is that it doesn’t block outside noises as well as leather. On the positive side, it breathes better and doesn’t trap heat against the ears (so no sweat buildup). Even though they are lightweight and heavily padded at the earcups and headband, they hold tightly to my head. I can look up and down and even shake my head from side to side without them falling off or moving out of position.<br /><br />I like that the headset charges with the more modern USB-C (unlike the FlightS), but keep in mind the cables you use for your PS4 controllers are Micro-USB. So, your older PS4 cables won’t be compatible. Thankfully there’s an included USB-C cable, which I measured at 22-inches long (1’ 10”). Could be longer, but gets the job done.<br /><br />The mic is OK. My gaming friends said they could hear me, but the voice quality isn’t the best. Could have something to do with it being wireless. They tell me it’s a problem on the FlightS as well, so it may just be a HyperX thing. While the mic isn’t removable and doesn’t collapse to hide inside the headset, it can rotate upward to get out of the way. I like that doing so mutes the mic since there isn’t a mute button elsewhere.<br /><br />The sound quality is OK. I’d call the bass and treble middling. Meaning, not the richest bass or crispest treble, but a decent middling level. It’s a gaming headset, not music, so the sound quality is more appropriate for that. The only thing I’d note is that you can’t turn down the bass to better hear footsteps and minimize explosions in FPS. To compare, the sound quality is about the same as it is on the more expensive FlightS (although that has the ability to go 7.1 surround which pretty much eliminates bass for FPS). If sound quality is important to you, look toward SteelSeries. I find their headsets often sound the best, while Razer is more similar to HyperX. At least, when it comes to music and movies. Gaming is often more about function than impressive tones.<br /><br />### Conclusion ###<br /><br />I love how comfortable this headset is. One of the most comfortable ones I’ve ever owned. That said, I’ll primarily use it on the PS4 and hope it works on the PS5 when it comes out. For PC, I’ll keep with the FlightS for its more advanced features.", "ParentASIN": "B0BSWX56ZG", "Timestamp": 1599246931731, "ItemName": "HyperX Cloud Stinger Core - Gaming Headset for PlayStation 4 and 5, Over-Ear Wired Headset with Mic, Passive Noise Cancelling, Immersive In-Game Audio, In-Line Audio Control, Black", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.5, "RatingCount": 17852, "Price": 29.49, "Categories": ["Video Games", "PlayStation 4", "Accessories", "Headsets"], "Description": "The product is a comfortable, circumaural closed-back headset compatible with Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.

If you aren’t using it and don’t want the mic hanging off the headset, you have to unplug it and try not to lose it.<br /><br />You can mute the mic by pressing the bottom multimedia button on the left earcup (can be changed to a different button in the software). The buttons are indented, so you can feel for them without taking the headset off. When muted, a red light illuminates near the tip of the mic.<br /><br />The mic picks up my voice fairly well. Initially, I had it too close to my mouth and people told me I sounded muffled. Once I moved it about 2 inches away it sounded better. I did have some issues with people telling me I occasionally sounded like a robot. I tried rebooting my computer, but that didn’t fix it. The only thing I found that works is to unplug the USB adapter and then plug it back in. Can be a little annoying because the robot voice doesn’t pick up in the sidetone, so testing in advance can be tricky.<br /><br />No mic sensitivity option in the NGenuity software like there is in Razer Synapse 3. So, if you have a loud mechanical keyboard or fan running, it’ll get picked up in the mic and annoy teammates. Forcing you to use Push-To-Talk in that situation.<br /><br />### Charging ###<br /><br />The buzz for this headset is that it can be charged using Qi wireless. But, keep in mind the charger is sold separately and retails for $59.99. Supposedly other Qi chargers work, but I haven’t tried it myself. I have a hanger for my headset at the side of my desk, so the Qi feature is less important to me—it would just take up more desk space. As such, I’ve been using the included USB charging cable.<br /><br />I measured the USB charging cable at 42-inch (3’ 6”) long. The positive is that you can use the headset while charging. The negative is that the cable is short, so unless you have USB ports in your keyboard or monitor, you may need to purchase a longer cord. The other negative is that it uses the older Micro-USB rather than the newer USB Type-C technology. I expected the latter for a newer release like this.<br /><br />The battery life is pretty good. I can go several days without charging, even a week depending on how many hours I use it. Keep in mind that the battery is not user replaceable and “may only be removed by Kingston or a professional service provider.” So when it’s dead, it’s dead (not worth the money to replace).<br /><br />This set only comes with a USB cable, not a wall charger, so you need to use your own or plug it into a port on your computer.<br /><br />### Sound ###<br /><br />A slight whooshing sound is noticeable when audio isn’t pumping through. A background white noise. But, it’s pretty subtle and you can’t hear it when sound is active.<br /><br />There is little to no bass. Especially in 7.1 Surround Sound mode. HyperX designed this headset purely for gaming. The lack of bass is to prevent explosions and other deep sounds from covering up the positional triggers (such as footsteps) of your opponents. But those of you who like to listen to music while gaming—or use the headset outside of gaming for music and movies—will find the sound quality to be lacking. Unlike some other gaming headphone software, there is no equalizer in NGenuity. You can’t set up different sound profiles for gaming and entertainment. You can try and use third-party options like Equalizer APO to improve the bass, but it takes some messing around.<br /><br />### Fitting ###<br /><br />Lightweight and comfortable. I weighed the headset in at 11 ounces (316 grams—less than a can of soda). Earcups go over and around your ears without being too bulky. I wear computer glasses and they work with the headset just fine—doesn't dig into my temples. The headband adds pressure to the earcups, which keeps them securely on your head even when looking down, but it can make them feel uncomfortable over time (with or without glasses). When wearing for two hours, I didn’t have a problem, but my ears did get sore after four hours or so. Might just be part of the break-in period.<br /><br />Not that it matters to most people, but I measured the USB adapter at 66.7mm (2.62”) long, 20mm (0.78”) wide, and 7.7mm (0.3”) thick.<br /><br />### Software ###<br /><br />NGenuity software is still in beta (as of this review, March 2020) and only rated 1.5 stars out of 5 by over 200 users in the Microsoft Store. It’s limited when compared to software like Razer Synapse 3 and Logitech G HUB. It can’t even minimize to the system tray when running: the best it can do is minimize to your taskbar. Plus it’s buggy. For instance, I often hear sidetone even when I have it turned off, making me have to toggle the switch on and off again.<br /><br />The software lets you adjust game volume, microphone volume, game-chat volume balance, and toggle sidetone and 7.1 surround sound. You can also reassign the four buttons on the left earcup to any of the options listed below. But that’s about it. Like I said, pretty limited.<br /><br />- Multimedia Buttons (left side)<br />- Sidetone Toggle<br />- Game Mixer<br />- Chat Mixer<br />- Mute Microphone<br />- Play/Pause<br />- Next<br />- Previous<br />- Mute Volume<br />- Mute All<br />- Volume Up<br />- Mic Volume Up<br />- Mic Volume Down<br /><br />### Conclusion ###<br /><br />For just gaming, I do like this headset and have been using it for about a month now. I like that it is wireless, so no cords get in my way. My favorite feature is being able to lower the game volume so I can better hear my teammates in chat. (Some games even with volume set to 1% are still too loud, so this is a nice option.)<br /><br />The overall features are limited, and it's uses outside of gaming are questionable. There are no cool lighting effects like many other gaming headsets have. It’s fairly plain. My hope is that they improve the software over time, allowing features such as an equalizer with different sound profiles and mic sensitivity so keyboard clicks don’t get picked up. For now, it’s a little barebones, but has potential.", "ParentASIN": "B082R1GMV2", "Timestamp": 1585671068584, "ItemName": "HyperX Cloud Flight S - Wireless Gaming Headset, 7.1 Surround Sound, 30 Hour Battery Life, Qi Wireless Charging, Detachable Microphone with LED Mute Indicator, Compatible with PC & PS4", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.4, "RatingCount": 3109, "Price": 999.0, "Categories": ["Video Games", "PC", "Accessories", "Headsets"], "Description": "The headphones feature a frequency response of 10Hz–20kHz, over-ear fit, and gaming-grade 2.4 GHz wireless connectivity with a battery life of up to 30 hours.

These are to replace the standard ABS keycaps (short for “Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene”) on keyboards, which become shiny and wear out over time. Or, if you just like the cool colors, that’s a good reason to get these too!<br /><br />I got the Razer Doubleshot PBT Keycaps to replace the factory keys on my Razer Huntsman Elite Gaming Keyboard. After using the Huntsman for a handful of months, several of the keys (particularly the W, A, S, D for obvious reasons) became shiny and were more slippery than I like. Especially during intense gaming where my fingers get a bit sweaty. These Razer PBT keys have a slight texture on the surface, eliminating the slipperiness. And it does so without feeling too sandpapery or scratchy. Razer got the amount of texture just right, IMO.<br /><br />This set comes with everything you need. A key removal tool (which works really slick), all standard keys, numpad keys, and alternate keys to match size differences between keyboards (such as two diff. sized Windows, alt, ctrl, enter, and shift keys). Even has stabilizers for those wider keycaps.<br /><br />That said, I did find something about these keycaps I consider unfavorable. At least with the Razer Green ones. They hinder the lighting effects. While yes, light does pass through the fonts on the keycaps, it doesn’t do so cleanly. How so? (1) The molding on the underside has a green tint, making any color of light passing through also tinted green. While this doesn’t totally kill orange and reds, it greatly hurts blues and purples (practically eliminating them). (2) The light passing through the characters is more muted and not very bright. (3) The light doesn’t cleanly pass thru all characters perfectly, such as the top of the ampersand. (4) Less light appears from underneath and between the keys. I measured the Huntsman’s original (standard size) key width at 17.6mm and the Razer PBT at 18.2mm. While a 0.6mm difference might not seem like a lot, it does block more light from underneath, causing the effects to look less impressive. (5) At the top of the keycap, light leaks at the sides of each character. Instead of just the character lighting up, the area around also glows (softly) causing a more muddied, less precise effect.<br /><br />In conclusion, I do find these keycaps to be a functionally high-end upgrade. The green coloring is pretty cool, too. But it comes at the price of lowing the effectiveness of the lighting by lowering its brightness, accuracy and clarity. Razer Chroma is much less cool with these keycaps installed. For instance, the fire effect is way too muted, tinted, and blocked around the edges to even look fire-like. Just as the color wheel is much less colorful. If dynamic lighting is important to you, these may not be a good fit. If functionally and durability is what you are after, I definitely recommend them.", "ParentASIN": "B09CG15F86", "Timestamp": 1579553266332, "ItemName": "Razer Doubleshot PBT Keycap Upgrade Set for Mechanical & Optical Keyboards: Compatible with Standard 104/105 US and UK layouts - Classic Black", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.5, "RatingCount": 5655, "Price": null, "Categories": ["Video Games", "PC", "Accessories", "Gaming Keyboards"], "Description": "The product features oil-resistant doubleshot PBT keycaps compatible with Razer Mechanical and Optical keyboards, as well as standard 104/105 US and UK layouts.

It’s very well made. Being mechanical, the keys are louder than a traditional keyboard when pressed (which can get picked up on your mic when chatting in game), but I found them to be quieter than my Razer Huntsman Elite Gaming Keyboard. The sound of the keys on the HyperX Alloy Origins comes when the inside of the keycap hits the upper case (so, when pressed all the way down), whereas the Huntsman does that as well as adds an extra clicking sound that’s built into each key. Thus, the HyperX Alloy Origins is quieter.<br /><br />Both the Huntsman and this Alloy Origins use the HyperX Red Switch Type. Their response time is very similar, but I do feel the Huntsman is slightly better in that regard. Maybe. Their keys are both extremely springy and easy to press that it’s difficult to measure. Regardless, both are way more responsive than a standard membrane keyboard. Not only are mechanical keyboards better for gaming, but they have a longer lifespan (30 to 70 million key presses vs. 5 million), and don’t wear out (no clattering or stuck keys).<br /><br />So, as far as hardware goes, the two keyboards are pretty close in quality. But there are differences between the software. The software for the HyperX Alloy Origins Core is called HyperX NGenuity, and it’s only got 2 stars on the Microsoft App store. Seems to be fairly buggy, although I haven’t had too many issues yet on my end. The software for the Razer Huntsman Elite is called Razer Synapse 3. Both let you re-assign keys, block keys in gaming mode, and tweak the lighting effects. But I find that Razer Synapse 3 has a lot more options. Such as the Chroma Studio for advanced lighting effects, the ability to set macros, and option to auto-load custom profiles when games you assign them are loaded.<br /><br />HyperX Alloy Origins lighting effects: [Looped:] Breathing, Confetti, Swipe, Solid, Twilight, Wave.

[Reactive:] Sun.<br /><br />Razer Huntsman Elite lighting effects: Ambient Awareness, Audio Meter, Breathing, Fire, Reactive, Ripple, Spectrum Cycling, Starlight, Static, Wave, and Wheel. Plus, Chroma Studio for advanced customization.<br /><br />I like that the cord connecting the HyperX Alloy Origins keyboard is removable. Should you want a shorter or longer cord, or to quickly swap the keyboard between systems, you can purchase a separate USB-C to USB-A cable. Whereas the cord is unremovable on the Razer Huntsman Elite.<br /><br />In conclusion: for gaming, mechanical is the logical choice for performance, and HyperX Red Switch is among the best. Both this HyperX Alloy Origins Core and the Razer Huntsman Elite are high-quality gaming keyboards. The advantage of the HyperX Alloy Origins is that the keys are quieter than the Huntsman’s, but the disadvantage is more limited software.

Even at those settings, I find the 14” x 10” width (technically, it’s slightly under) of this mousepad large enough to handle that range of motion. Large enough for finger, wrist and even arm movement. I got this to replace my 15.8\" x 35.4\" XXL mousepad and haven’t had an issue with the shortened range.<br /><br />The edges are thin and smooth, so if you rub your palm or wrist on the bottom edge, there is no discomfort or wearing on the pad.<br /><br />There is a small, fine texture on the bottom of the pad for friction. It holds the mousepad well to my wooden desk surface—even during high action gaming where I can go a little wild on the mouse.<br /><br />The pad's hard surface is more slippery than cloth and can sometimes make the mouse move on its own (if there is tension on the cord). It nearly glides as easily as a paddle on an air hockey table. A light tap will cause the mouse to slide a good half inch or more. Moving the mouse across this hard surface has a more sandpapery sound than the smooth brushing of cloth. That said, there is increased pinpoint accuracy, which is good for sniping and response time, and less pressure is needed.<br /><br />Being a hard pad also means there's no creases, bending or floppiness. It's stiff and holds extremely flat against a surface.<br /><br />The lighting effects on the edges offer these modes: Audio Meter, Breathing, Reactive, Spectrum Cycling, Static, and Wave. It doesn't have Fire, Ambient Awareness, Ripple, Starlight or Wheel like some other Razer products do. That said, you can use the Chroma Studio to create more advanced effects. For example, you can create something similar to Starlight by clicking on each light, setting the duration to 1 and color to random. It will blink similarly to the Starlight effect (you can do this on your Razer mouse, too). I counted 19 different lights around the outside of the pad that you can add custom settings to. Unfortunately, it won't let you customize the light for the logo on the upper right.<br /><br />You can adjust the brightness of the lighting and have it switch off when the display is off.<br /><br />If you are on macOS, you are stuck with using the older Razer Synapse 2 software. Unfortunately, the Firefly doesn’t work with version 2, only version 3. So, you can’t change the lighting when in macOS. It’s stuck on a random breathing color mode, which slowly fades one solid color at a time. As of this review (Dec 2019), the Firefly is clearly made for Windows users only (which isn’t ideal for people like me who switch back and forth on Bootcamp).<br /><br />The overall quality of this mousepad feels good, and while limited, the chroma lighting works awesome in conjunction with my Razer Huntsman Elite keyboard and DeathAdder Elite and Lancehead Tournament Edition mice.

This sensor is part of what makes this mouse so costly. That said, I found the sniper button (located at the tip of your thumb) to be fairly stiff to press. Since you need to keep it depressed for the lower DPI to stay active, there were times I found myself pressing so hard with my thumb that I was fighting against my wrist when controlling the mouse position. I wish the sniper button required less pressure.<br /><br />Thankfully the right and left mouse button clicks are responsive and do not require excessive pressure. They work just as well as the buttons on my Logitech G403 (ASIN: B01KUAMCWI) and Razer Lancehead TE (ASIN: B06XH15HD9).<br /><br />The scroll wheel depresses with little effort too, but has a slight rattle when scrolling up and down. It presses down with far less pressure needed than the G403 and about the same pressure as the Razer Lancehead TE.<br /><br />You can adjust the size of the mouse’s length and width. I measured the minimum length at 11cm and maximum at 12.5cm. The minimum width is 7cm and max is 7.6cm. Keep in mind that when extending the width, you are rotating the left side of the mouse (where your thumb sits). In doing so there’s no exact measurement as it goes further out at the front than it does the center. My measurements are from center.<br /><br />According to Rocket Jump Ninja (an expert on gaming mice), the ideal size of mouse should be roughly 60% as long and wide as your hand. I have a large mouse hand, which measures 20cm long x 10cm wide. The ideal mouse size for me is 12cm x 6cm. The R.A.T. 8+ is adjustable to 12cm long, so that’s a perfect length for me, but the width cannot be adjusted under 7cm, which is 1cm too wide for my ideal grip. I don’t find this to feel too bad personally, but it is wider than the G403 (6.3cm) and Lancehead TE (6cm) that I am used to using for gaming. And again, I have large hands, so if you have smaller hands the width might prove to be uncomfortable/awkward for you.<br /><br />You can swap out the palm rest with a textured option or one that sits higher up. There are two additional pinky finger rests too, one with texture and one with a ledge you can rest your finger on. There is a tool on the mouse itself that you remove to use on the screws. I personally like the feel of the textured options. If you don’t like your finger to touch your mouse pad, you may like the option that provides a ledge for it to sit on.<br /><br />I weighed the mouse (with some cord) at 155.5g. After removing the weights, it measured at 138.6g. Even without the weights this is a fairly heavy mouse. In comparison, my unweighted G403 is 106.7g (and that’s with a battery) and Lancehead TE is 104.5g. There are debates as to what is better for gaming: light mouse or heavy. It essentially comes down to preference and which helps you aim better. That said, if you tend to lift your mouse (like for flicking), the heavier weight may cause you more fatigue.<br /><br />One thing that really annoys me with this mouse is the position of the screw-head on the left side—which is next to the sniper button. It’s a screw not meant to be removed, and is positioned so that the tip of my thumb is always touching it. Doesn’t matter how I adjust the left side (tilted, forward or backward), I can always feel it rubbing against my thumb. The head of the screw sticks slight out and constantly irritates me. But keep in mind I am hypersensitive, so some people may not even notice it—or get used to it. IMO, it’s a design flaw.<br /><br />Another thing I don’t like is the lack of linking games in the software. On both the Razer and Logitech software options, you can link games to specific DPI and other settings. For example, when in my OS I like the mouse resolution set to 1600 DPI, but when playing Overwatch, I want it at 800 DPI. With my other mice the DPI would instantly change as soon as I loaded the game. On the R.A.T. I have to remember to switch it manually (either by clicking through profiles or on the DPI button). Which isn’t the end of the world, but is a feature I had grown accustom too. As such, I sometimes forget to change it halfway through a game before I realize my play is affected due to the wrong DPI setting.<br /><br />I find the lighting options to be OK but limited, especially in comparison to the Chroma features of the Lancehead TE.<br /><br />For people who use macOS, know that there is no software support for the R.A.T. on mac. I switch back and forth between macOS (for work) and Windows (for gaming) on the same system, and dislike that I cannot fully tweak the mouse in macOS to work the same as on Windows—like I can with the G403 and Lancehead TE.<br /><br />Overall, I have mixed feelings about this mouse. I like that there is a sniper button, but dislike that I have to push it so hard. I like that I can adjust the fit, but dislike that the width won’t go under 7cm. I like that I can switch between profiles, but dislike that the software doesn’t have game linking. I personally find that I play a little slower when using this mouse—likely due to grip and weight—but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing as it can help me play smarter and avoid mistakes. I wish MadCatz would have better placed the screw on the left side so it doesn’t bother my thumb, but I like the added thumb barrel for scrolling sideways—which is lacking in my other mice. I’d rate this mouse at 3.5 stars, but am rounding it up to 4 because it really does have a good sensor and enough positives to outweigh some of the negatives.<br /><br />In case you are interested in the math* to determine ideal hand to mouse size:<br /><br />My hand size:<br />20cm x 10cm.<br />(Note: Height measured from top of wrist to point of longest finger, and width of hand measured from side-to-side above thumb.)<br /><br />60% of Length:<br />20cm ÷ 100 = 0.20<br />0.20 x 60 = 12cm<br /><br />60% of Width:<br />10cm ÷ 100 = 0.10<br />0.10 x 60 = 6cm<br /><br />The ideal mouse at 60% my hand size is 12cm x 6cm.<br /><br />Just swap my numbers for yours, and keep in mind the R.A.T. 8+ dimensions are:<br />Length: 11cm-12.5cm<br />Width: 7cm-7.6cm<br /><br />* Thanks to Rocket Jump Ninja for this equation.", "ParentASIN": "B092PKTLGW", "Timestamp": 1557879134460, "ItemName": "Mad Catz R.A.T. 8+ Adjustable Wired Gaming Mouse - 16000 DPI - 11 Programmable Buttons - 4 User Profiles Stored Directly - Customize RGB LED - Additional Palm Rests and Pinky Supports - Black", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.3, "RatingCount": 1544, "Price": 75.99, "Categories": ["Video Games", "PC", "Accessories", "Gaming Mice"], "Description": "The mouse features multi-button functionality for enhanced precision and control, including a scroll wheel, multiple click buttons, and adjustable DPI up to 16,000.

The logo on the outside of the earpieces is simply stamped on. It’s not a light like their other headsets. That said, a glowing logo is pretty boring anyway. I’m honestly surprised that Razer doesn’t have a cool lighting system on any of their headsets (as of this review, Dec. 2018). Even their mouse has multiple lights that can be set to do cool things like starlight effects. So to me, the lack of lighting isn’t a big deal. Not until they have a headset that fully takes advantage of it.<br /><br />Side Note: I’ve gone through many different gaming headphones over the years, from low-end options like the Bon Venu Wings of Angel to medium range like Corsair Vengeance 2100 and Turtle Beach Phantom to higher-end like SteelSeries Siberia 650. In my opinion, none of them are perfect. But the one I used the most before now was the SteelSeries Siberia 650 (ASIN: B00MSOEWQY).<br /><br />### Manual Controls / Cord Length ###<br /><br />There are two cords. First is the cord for the headset that ends with a 3.5 mm plug. This is a single plug that has both the left and right audio channel as well as the mic (like a mobile phone headset). It does not have the audio and mic on separate plugs. This would be a problem for people who have sound cards with separate mic/audio plugins if it wasn't for the fact that the second cord (the THX cord) plugs into your computer’s USB port. So you are plugging the single 3.5 mm plug from the headphones into the THX soundcard, which then plugs into your computer’s USB port. I know, sounds kinda confusing, but ultimately important to know. Especially if you ever plan on using the headset without the THX option.<br /><br />There’s a small plastic control approximately 14” down the headset wire. This put it just below my chest level. Easy to reach for without having to look. It has a mic mute and volume adjuster (up and down). 39.5” below that you have the 3.5 mm plug. I measured the full headset cord (from the earpiece to the 3.5 mm plug) at 56”. The USB Audio Controller (the THX soundcard) has a secondary option to control volume and mic mute. It also allows you to adjust the chat volume separately as well as the bass (for those times you can’t hear your mates clearly and/or there’s too much boom in the explosions). I measured the THX cord at 84.5” (the box itself is 3.375 long by 1.25” wide by 0.5” deep). So that gives you a combined 140.5” cord length. Plenty long enough to reach the back of my computer’s USB port and provide more than enough slack.<br /><br />The plastic box (THX soundcard) for the USB Audio Controller feels a little cheap, but does help to make it lighter. I weighed it in at 25.3 grams. It can get a little confusing having two different mic mutes and volume adjusters on your cord, so I personally recommend having both set to 100% and controlling what you can though your computer. Or just pick and stay with one.<br /><br />I actually preferred the mic mute and volume controls on the earpieces of my Siberia 650. Easier to reach and doesn't weigh down the cord, but it does make the headset heavier.<br /><br />### Software ###<br /><br />You’ll need to download and install the RAZER SYNAPSE 3 software. This is where you adjust the sound and mic settings. There is currently no macOS support. On my mac, I downloaded RAZER SYNAPSE 2 (V#2) because it has a macOS version, but it does not recognize the Razer Kraken headset. It requires RAZER SYNAPSE 3 (V#3). You will get default sound but are unable to tweak anything (including the lack of being able to activate the THX sound). When I asked Razer what the ETA on having a macOS version of #3 was, they said their team is still working on it and would not even hint at a release date. This might not matter to you as most gamers are on PC, but I do have friends who like gaming on a mac. For my situation, I mainly use macOS for doing work (I’m a graphic designer) and use Boot Camp to load Windows 10 for gaming. But because I use the same computer for both, it would be nice if I could get full support on both. This is a knock against Razer because the latest version of the SteelSeries 3 engine for the Siberia 650 fully runs on macOS and PC.<br /><br />### Sound ###<br /><br />I’m not 100% sold on the THX spatial audio. I toggled it off and on and had a hard time finding a huge benefit with it. Except perhaps for detecting footsteps in-game. While it does change things up, I didn’t notice a huge advantage. I spent a lot of time adjusting the equalizer and no matter what I changed, it still seemed like there was a slight echo. None of the default sound options were any good IMO (game, music, movie). That said, if you put it to custom and tweak it just right, you can get decent bass and treble. I personally like these settings: | 31Hz: 6db | 63Hz: 11db | 125Hz: 3db | 250Hz: 0db | 500Hz: 2db | 1kHz: 2db | 2kHz: 5db | 4kHz: 3db | 8kHz: 12db | 16kHz: 12db |<br /><br />It’s difficult to come up with settings that work well with both gaming and music, and there’s only one “custom” option. I wish I could edit the game, music and movie options, but you can only make changes to the custom portion. Thankfully you can set up different profiles and thus create different custom options that way. While I didn’t find a quick way to switch between profiles manually, you can link games and assign specific profiles to them—so that, when the game loads, the custom sound profile will load with it.<br /><br />Keep in mind that sound quality is subjective. I personally like the overall sound I got from the Siberia 650 better. But I had used them for so long it’s possible I just got used to their specific tonality.<br /><br />Another thing I noticed is that the Razer Kraken doesn’t block a lot of outside noises when no sound is running through them. I have them on my head now and can hear kids playing at the park across the street. But as soon as I get audio pumping through them, it seems to drown out noises fairly well.<br /><br />### Mic ###<br /><br />As mentioned, I use the Razer Huntsman Elite keyboard. It’s a mechanical keyboard and as such, the key-clicks are pretty loud. In fact, the mechanical keys on this particular keyboard are on the top end of the loud-clicking scale. I had trouble with my other headphones (Siberia 650) picking up the key clicks in-game and irritating teammates. The clicking was loud enough to activate the microphone even when I wasn’t talking, and the SteelSeries Engine 3 software didn’t have a good option to adjust mic input sensitivity. (All you get is an on/off toggle for mic noise reduction, which is limited to say the least.) Windows doesn’t have a good option either, even if you install the Realteck driver to activate “noise suppression.” This forced me to use push-to-talk options, which I hate because I don’t always remember to push it during intense parts of a game. That, and it can distract from more important keystrokes.<br /><br />This is where the RAZER SYNAPSE 3 software excels for the Razer Kraken. It has several controls for the microphone: Mic volume, mic sensitivity, sidetone toggle and volume, volume normalization, ambient noise reduction, and vocal clarity.<br /><br />Mic sensitivity can be adjusted from 0-100, or it can be set to “automatically determine mic input levels.” What’s great about this is I can type on my keyboard keys to see how loud they are (it visually shows current level intake), then set the mic sensitivity just above that threshold. Doing this makes it so the sound of the keyboard clicks no longer activates the microphone. Therefore no need for push-to-talk. You just have to be sure to speak louder than your sensitivity setting.<br /><br />This also works good for my desk fan. Before, the fan blowing at me (and thus my mic) would occasionally get picked up. With the mic sensitivity settings, I can test to see what level the fan is at, then put the sensitivity higher. Thankfully the fan noise is a lower level than the mechanical keyboard, so the keyboard sensitivity setting also covers the fan.<br /><br />While this is great, my keyboard clicks and fan noise still do get picked up when I’m actually talking. The clicking and blowing won't activate the mic, but the mic still includes these sounds when active. That’s where the \"ambient noise reduction\" option comes into play. I turned this on and set it to 50% and now the keyboard clicks are much quieter and almost unrecognizable. The only bad thing about this is my voice sounds more muddy/muffled than with the option off, but it’s still recognizable and understandable, which is the most important part.<br /><br />Honestly, I thought the default mic settings were pretty good. But with the loudness of my mechanical keyboard, the extra tweaks improve it even further.<br /><br />### Comfort / Fit ###<br /><br />The earcups are extremely soft, and the inside is lined with cloth. I’ve worn them for more than two hours at a time and have had no discomfort. Nor did they get sweaty. The headset breathes well and is light overall, lighter than my Siberia 650. The headband has a fair amount of padding too. The only bad thing about having such low pressure against your ears is that the headset can slide off your head if you look down. Since I don’t do that too often when gaming, this isn’t a problem for me. I’m able to wear glasses comfortably too; the padding doesn’t push the temples into my skin.<br /><br />### Bugs ###<br /><br />When switching THX off and on during game a popping and crackling kicks on. You have to close out the game to get it to stop. Sometimes you have to reboot the computer. If you are playing competitive, I highly recommend picking your sound settings before booting up the game. Worst thing to happen is to get stuck with ear-piercing screeches in the middle of a competitive game that you can’t back out of without harming your record.<br /><br />### Conclusion ###<br /><br />After using these Razer Kraken for a month, I decided to fully switch over to them from my Siberia 650. While I preferred the sound and physical controls of the Siberia 650, the mic settings on the Razer Kraken are much better. Especially with my loud mechanical keyboard. The Kraken are lighter too, and comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Plus, I like that it matches my set. I was more critical of the Razer Kraken at first, but they have grown on me and I find I prefer them overall.", "ParentASIN": "B09C4DPKGF", "Timestamp": 1544740901017, "ItemName": "Razer Kraken Tournament Edition THX 7.1 Surround Sound Gaming Headset: Retractable Noise Cancelling Mic - USB DAC -  For PC, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X & S, Mobile – Black", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.4, "RatingCount": 13095, "Price": 69.9, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation", "Accessories"], "Description": "The headset features THX 7.1 Surround Sound for enhanced audio realism, custom-tuned 50 mm drivers for immersive gaming, and cooling gel-infused cushions for comfort.

But the clicking sound was louder than I expected, making gaming at night while the family is sleeping more difficult. You might need to adjust your headset mic sensitivity level so it doesn’t pick up on the mic when chatting in-game. If you use a monitor mic, know that the loud keyclicks will get picked up and drive your allies crazy.<br /><br />The keyboard layout is pretty good, but keys are closer together than I’m used to. As a result, I occasionally hit the wrong key when typing, but that’ll improve as my muscle memory refreshes. In fact, I’m writing this review on the keyboard now and am not having too much difficulty.<br /><br />I really like the wrist rest. It’s very comfortable. I have pretty large hands and long fingers, but find my palm seats well on the lower edge of the rest. The plastic edge--past the padding--is fairly sharp, but I don’t have a problem with it because I never touch that area. The leathery finish is soft and comfortable, but I do worry it could wear out over time. The wrist rest attaches to the keyboard well and doesn’t accidentally detach because it’s held by strong magnets.<br /><br />Besides the wrist rest, this Elite version of the Huntsman also has media buttons. The volume dial increases and decreases with a twist, which is easy to do since it extends slightly beyond the frame of the keyboard. The button on the dial mutes the sound. The three buttons to the left are to play/pause and to go to the next or previous track. I personally don’t like owning a keyboard without media controls as I listen to music on my system pretty much all the time, even when gaming. These ones work well (on a PC--see mac issues below) and look cool.<br /><br />The bottom of the keyboard has six rubber feet that prevent it from slipping or scratching your table’s surface. They are fairly wide too, unlike some keyboards with thin feet that rub off over time. There are two tilt legs with two different heights. This allows you to raise and angle the keyboard towards you. I personally have it at max height as I don’t like keyboards to lay flat. The wrist rest also has six rubber feet, so combined you have 12 in total. This bad boy clings to the table’s surface very well and I haven’t once had it move on me in-game.<br /><br />You’ll need to download and install the RAZER SYNAPSE 3 software. This is where you adjust the lighting (and sync with other Chroma devices), set up profiles, rebind keys, disable keys, assign macros, and so on. (Note that there are no dedicated macro keys on this keyboard.) Unfortunately, the software (as of September 2018) is in beta and is still quite buggy. I had it lock up when switching profiles under the customize screen and lose sync with the keyboard altogether. For instance, I bound the Caps Lock key to be Ctrl when in-game, but this doesn’t always work. In fact, I’ve had it lose sync with the game entirely and the only fix was to reboot the computer.<br /><br />I linked the game Overwatch to its own profile and found the preset key lighting to be pretty cool. It highlights the standard move keys (W, A, S, D) a bright yellow and also highlights different usable keys throughout the game, such as the “H” key when in spawn letting you know you can change heroes there. It also changes key colors for abilities usage—once an ability is ready to use, the key (such as E) shows as blue. During cooldown the key blinks orange. While I rarely look down at my keyboard when playing, I do find it helpful when my ultimate is ready and all the keys flash blue. I can see this at the corner of my eye. This is useful for times I get distracted in a fight and don’t glance at the bottom of the screen to see where my ult charge is at. I would not call this game changing, but I would say it’s helpful.<br /><br />There is currently no macOS support. I downloaded RAZER SYNAPSE 2 because it has a macOS version, but it does not recognize the Huntsman Elite keyboard. When I asked Razer what the ETA on having a macOS version of RAZER SYNAPSE 3 was, they said, “There will be hunstman support for [mac]OS our Team is still working on that as of now and we don't have visibility.” I then asked if I could get access to the developer alpha releases, but was told no. The keyboard still works on a mac, but it’s limited. You cannot use the play/pause or next/previous media buttons, but you can use the volume and mute. You are also unable to tweak or adjust the lighting on the keyboard (it’s stuck at breathing random colors). I even tried setting profiles in Windows and saved it to the keyboard’s internal memory, but it didn’t change anything when in macOS. This might not matter to you as most gamers are on PC, but I do have friends who like gaming on a mac. For my situation, I mainly use macOS for doing work (I’m a graphic designer) and use Boot Camp to load Windows 10 for gaming. But because I use the same computer for both, it would be nice if I could get full support on both OS. (Note: my mac has a 4GHz i7 processor with 32GB RAM, so it works just fine for gaming).<br /><br />If you’re like me, you don’t have a ton of USB ports to spare. Which is why I don’t like that the Huntsman uses 2 USB ports. One for the keyboard and one marked PORT for the track lighting (the lighting at the bottom/underside of the keyboard and wrist rest). Razer says to use your computer’s USB ports or a powered USB hub. I plugged the keyboard into my computer, then tried using an unpowered hub for the track lighting, but it would flicker (not enough power). Thankfully the lighting for the keyboard keys are connected to the keyboard USB port, so if the track lighting isn’t that important to you, you can just unplug it and still have lighting on the keys themselves. It’s also noteworthy to mention there are no USB pass-through ports. This means you can’t plug a flash drive or anything like that to the keyboard itself. Might not be a big deal to some, but all my previous keyboards had this option and I only have 4 USB ports on my system (one of the dumb things about Apple). Between this keyboard and mouse, 3 of the 4 ports are used (not to mention I have USB controlled headphones and an external HD). I can see investing in a powered HUB in my near future.<br /><br />Overall, I find this is a really good keyboard, so I’m giving it 4 stars.

Spent more hours than I can remember sitting on my couch with a buddy—in split-screen—repeating the story mode. But what we spent the most time on was the Terrorist Hunt. Things have changed.<br /><br />In Rainbow Six Seige there is no split-screen co-op option. While I realize game makers (other than Nintendo) have been deliberately getting away from this, I think it’s a real shame. Not everyone wants to sit alone at home and play some unknown 10-year-old online who makes lewd comments about their mother. Sure, you can play with your friends online too, but that’s assuming they also have the same gaming system and have purchased their own copy of the game. Oh and wait, you need to pay for an annual PlayStation Plus membership to access online play as well. Gone are the days where friends hang out in the same room and purchase a single copy to enjoy together.<br /><br />That’s not the only thing I was disappointed about. Here are others:<br /><br />No story mode. Meaning, no campaign. This too was removed from the franchise. The closest you get is something called “Situations.” It’s basically a group of 10 different scenarios you run though. There’s no ongoing story, just 10 random objectives. For example, with one, you are supposed to go into a building and rescue a hostage, then escort them safely out. With another, you are to go into a building and defuse a bomb while holding it against waves of enemies who are trying to reactivate it. Another takes place in an airbus. And so on. They are OK, and fairly challenging (especially since you don’t regain health), but they do not replace an ongoing plot.<br /><br />They removed the ability to hug a wall (take cover) to peak around corners. Sure, you can lean right and lean left [by pressing in the analog sticks], but all that does is put your crosshairs at a slight angle/tilt. It does not replace the ability to hold snugly against a wall or object (to keep from accidently moving) and get in more stealthy shots. In Rainbow Six Seige, there is much less stealth and your surroundings are more exposed. The game is less about sneaking and positioning yourself undetected—instead, it’s more about running in with guns blazing.<br /><br />The Terrorist Hunt feels like something that was slapped together. I was not able to find a way to pick the map (like in Rainbow Six Vegas 2), and rather than being an actual terrorist hunt (meaning, kill all the terrorists), it’s random scenarios and maps, such as “free the hostage.” The lack of settings and customization is annoying—it’s nothing like the original.<br /><br />Ultimately, this game is all about the online multiplayer mode. Everything else has been stripped away. I did enjoy it on some levels, such as the added ability to blast through walls and floors (designated walls and floors, that is), and the graphics are indeed much better than the old Rainbow Six Vegas 2. But I found I got bored with it way more quickly, and didn’t have the overall enjoyment I’ve come to expect.<br /><br />This edition of the game comes with the Year 2 Pass.

The Logitech software (downloaded online) runs on Windows (10, 8.1, 8, and 7) and Mac (OS X 10.10.x or later), and I personally use it on both. For reference, I have the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display set to dual boot. Using Boot Camp, I load OS X for my graphic design work, and Windows 10 for gaming. I have found that the performance of the mouse is the same regardless of operating system. It even performs admirably in Parallels. However, there are a few missing features in the software for OS X (see below).<br /><br />For Graphic Design, in OS X, I use the Adobe Creative Suite, which includes programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. In the past I’ve had accuracy issues with wireless mice. For instance, when I’m dragging a marquee box there are times I need to move it by a single pixel. Other wireless mice I’ve owned shifted several pixels at a time so I couldn’t quite get it to the spot I wanted. Not so with the Logitech G403. It has pinpoint accuracy, letting me move the cursor one pixel at a time and without any choppiness (it's smooth). Because the resolution adjusts from 200 – 12,000 dpi, you can get even higher accuracy. But even at 3200 dpi, I feel comfortable dragging it without any slop or skipping or jumping.<br /><br />For Gaming, in Windows 10, I play a variety of types, from FPS like Overwatch to RTS like StarCraft 2. I find that the mouse’s reaction time in gaming is quite good for wireless. I experienced no lag or noticeable delays in movement, dragging, scrolling or button clicks. And as mentioned above, you can set the dpi to a wide range, lowering it to help with sniping or increasing it to gain faster movement. To switch between modes, you can do so by a quick click of a button near the scroll wheel.<br /><br />Should the battery die while the mouse is in use, you can plug in the included cord. This will charge the mouse while also connecting it to the computer, providing full control without the need for wireless. When switching between corded and un-corded, or even simply charging, the bad part of this is that the mouse ultimately takes up two USB ports. One for the cord (needed for charging and non-wireless play) and one for the wireless adapter. Had the mouse been designed to connect via Bluetooth, then no adapter would be needed (at least, for my setup), however Logitech used a different technology that requires you to use their own custom adapter (they claim this enables them to have more optimization, which seems to be the case). You could plug and unplug the two (cord and adapter) back and forth between one port, but that’s a pain. And personally, I would stay away from USB Hubs as that can impact the connection speed and responsiveness of the mouse. Ports in the motherboard (namely at the back of your desktop or side of your laptop) are ideal.<br /><br />Now there are some things I like better about my older SteelSeries Rival. Firstly, the Logitech G403 is wider than the Rival. I have a pretty large grip (big hands), so it’s not a deal breaker for me, but I do prefer a narrower grip. If you have small hands, it may very well be a deal breaker for you. Secondly, the sides of the G403 are smoother than the Rival. This means it’s more slippery and the friction does not grip my fingertips as well, so I feel like I have to squeeze the mouse tighter. Thirdly, the button clicks on the G403 are much louder than the Rival; that said, the scroll wheel is quieter and smoother to scroll with. Fourthly, there is a gap between the top buttons and the palm rest on the G403. The Rival has no gaps or seams on the top. However, I don’t find the gaps getting in my way; I never end up touching them, so it’s more of a visual preference than a physical annoyance.<br /><br />I measured the weight of the G403 at 107 grams vs. the 105 grams of the Rival. Very similar considering the G403 has to support a battery. Additionally, the G403 has an extra 10-gram weight you can put in at the bottom of the mouse to bring the total up to 117 grams. The majority of the weight on the G403 is at the front, so putting the added 10 grams on the back helps with balance. Personally, I like the ability to increase the weight, a feature I missed having when upgrading to the Rival from the Cyber Snipa CSLMSL01. (Note: For a weight comparison, a full can of soda pop is around 280 grams, which means that the G403, even fully weighted, is less than half that.)<br /><br />Because I switched from a wired to a wireless, the mouse no longer turns off when the computer shuts down. Thankfully, the G403 goes into sleep mode after a time so I don’t have to worry about the battery quickly draining if I forget to click the off switch at the bottom. You can also turn the lights off (scroll wheel light or icon at the palm rest or even both at once) in the Logitech software to help save on battery life. (Or if you like the lights, you can alternative lower the brightness to help extend the battery.) Logitech claims 22 hours of non-stop gaming with the lights on and 30 hours with the lights off. As far as I can tell, that is fairly accurate.<br /><br />Speaking of the software, it has a good amount of customization. You can set up three different profiles (good for switching between game types), change light color (and switch from solid, pulsing, or color cycle), view the battery life, tune the mouse to the surface of your mouse pad, update your firmware (for the mouse itself), assign new commands for each button, enter keystroke modifiers (for your keyboard), create keyboard macros, view “key press” heat map stats (shows which keys you press the most) and install Overwolf (a program that allows you to overlay your desktop and games with widgets). As mentioned above, there are some differences between the OS X and Windows version of the software. In OS X, you don’t get Overwolf (not supported) and you don’t have the Developer tab in settings (which allows you to launch ARX Console, LED Emulator and LCD Emulator). Other than that, as far as I can tell, everything else is available.<br /><br />Overall, I think the Logitech G403 is a good wireless solution for both Graphic Design and Gaming, and on either Windows or OS X. Good customization and responsiveness (my buddy even told me I was quicker when playing Overwatch). I just wish the mouse was narrower and had better gripping on the sides.<br /><br />PACKAGE CONTENTS:<br />Gaming Mouse<br />Charging/data cable<br />Wireless USB adapter<br />Cable adapter<br />10g optional weight<br />User documentation", "ParentASIN": "B01KUAMCWI", "Timestamp": 1493055204000, "ItemName": "Logitech G403 Wireless Gaming Mouse with High Performance Gaming Sensor", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.1, "RatingCount": 596, "Price": 199.99, "Categories": ["Video Games", "PC", "Accessories", "Gaming Mice"], "Description": "The Logitech G403 mouse offers advanced gaming performance with a response time up to 8x faster than standard mice, ensuring near-instantaneous clicks and movements.

This is important when pressing against the levers; the unit doesn’t move around when adjusting on the fly. Even the analog volume feels solid and well built; no slop in the controls whatsoever.<br /><br />As is typically with Turtle Beach, they provide a plethora of ports. You have Aux in, stream out, digital optical in and out, and even an Ethernet port for connecting more than one device (should you want a local lag-free chat network). Also typical with Turtle Beach is their generosity with providing cables. You have your USB mini power cable (PC hookup), digital optical cable, USB micro programming cable, and AUX for stream / Xbox One chat.<br /><br />While this was built to go hand-in-hand with their Elite Pro Tournament Gaming Headset, you can use your own headset should you wish. For instance, I tested this using the budgeted Bon Venu Wings of Angel. Just keep in mind that it WON’T work with gaming headsets that connect via USB. You need the traditional aux and mic connectors.<br /><br />Speaking of testing with the Wings of Angel, I was amazed at the quality increase I experienced by using the tactical audio controller. While I was impressed with the sound quality from the Wings of Angel before, I am now blown away. The bass is richer and the high notes are crisper, plus the controller successfully turned them into a 7.1 surround headset. A quick software test proved it was able to throw sounds in just the right places. If you are a little reluctant to fork out $200 for the tactical audio controller AND another $200 for the Elite Headset, don’t worry. Put your money into the controller and you will be surprised at how well a budget pair of headphones goes along with it.<br /><br />While I am a PS4 gamer, I mainly use the tactical audio controller on my Windows 10 PC. I’m mostly a Steam gamer with the occasional Blizzard game (notably SC2). Hooking this up to the PC was really simple; just attach the USB power cable to the device and PC and you are connected. From there you follow setting up the device in your Windows playback devices panel. Oddly enough, there is no software to install from Turtle Beach; it uses Window’s drivers and controls. This might worry some people as it seems less than advanced, but really, it works more slick than I had expected. The advanced control isn’t in the software so much as it is in the device itself.<br /><br />Also, because the audio controller holds all the components needed, you don't have to worry about the quality of your sound card. This is even more important when using a laptop as the built-in cards tend to be limited.<br /><br />Once you have everything installed and setup, you can start messing with the dials and controls. The customization is superb, and the presets are quite useful. There is:<br /><br />- Game Mode: Signature sound, Shooter, Superhuman hearing, and Footstep focus<br />- Movie Mode: Signature sound, Action, Horror, and Drama<br />- Music Mode: Signature sound, Stadium, Acoustic, and Dance<br />- Surround Off: Natural sound, Bass Booster, Bass & Treble Booster, and Vocal Booster<br /><br />(Oddly enough, I like listening to music in game mode on signature sound best.)<br /><br />Overall, this device is more useful and handy than I had thought. It brings sound quality up beyond my expectations, is built with a quality I’d expect from Bose, and provides a ton of audio control. You don’t have to be commentator to get everything out of this device. Even having a noisy family you want to drown out when chatting and playing online with buddies, this thing works great.

This pair by iDeaUSA costs a little more than some other budgets I've seen, but is still low in comparison to the high end of the spectrum. As with every pair of gaming headphones, there are pluses and minuses. I’ll do my best to point those out here.<br /><br />First off, style and design. For the most part I like it. The look is cool, with its blue pulsing lights on the outside of the ear cups and blue light at the tip of the mic (when not muted). I prefer a more matte look than glossy/shiny, but that’s just a matter of taste. While the ear cups are very shinny, there is some matte on the headband. I do like the funky sort of “X” on the outside that gives the design more definition, and the light blue padding at the bottom of the headband is classy. Overall a good build; no visual flaws in the stitching or defects in the plastic. The headset is a bit heavier than some others I’ve used, but they aren’t a brick either -- I didn’t feel like my head was overly weighed down, even after several hours of use. Instead of adjusting the height by pulling or pushing on the ear cups, the iDeaUSA inner headband applies a light pressure on your head, thus giving way until seated comfortably. This felt fine to me and I have no complaints with the fit. Everything seats well and feels comfortable.<br /><br />My favorite feature is the controls on the left ear cup. Not the controls so much as their location. You can lift your hand and easily feel for the buttons and dial. You can mute the mic, adjust the volume, and toggle the vibration (more on that later). Other headphones in the budget range tend to have the controls on the cord. While that functionally works, it can be annoying to have a large block of plastic rubbing against your chest. The fact that the iDeaUSA headphones have the controls on the earpiece gives them a huge thumbs up from me.<br /><br />Another area where these headphones excel is with crisp tones. This is one item I see lots of headset makers falling short on. They get you the bass and deep tones, but the higher notes are somewhat muffled. While not Bose quality, I am impressed with how crisp the high notes are from the iDeaUSA speakers. The bass isn’t shabby either. It hits pretty hard and provides good depth. Overall, the sound quality is quite solid and is easily the strength of these headphones.<br /><br />An interesting feature -- which I’ve never experienced before -- is the vibrating earpieces. When I fist put them on this feature threw me off. I was like, wait, did my headset just vibrate like a dualshock controller? I played around with turning this off and on and, after a while, found I got used to it. The interesting thing with the vibration is that it fakes the rumbling frequency you’d expect from a subwoofer. While it is not always fitting, such as when listening to some types of music, it does increase the drama and bass effect when playing games -- especially when there are explosions. Interesting feature. iDeaUSA was smart to let you toggle it off and on. The only thing I wish they had provided was a way to increase or decrease the intensity of the vibration. As it is, you either have it active or you don’t.<br /><br />There is some noise canceling, but not a lot. I tested them by turning the sound off and listening for outside noises. I could easily hear my fingers clicking on the keyboard, the sound of distance traffic and even the softly playing music from my desktop speakers. To contrast, I tossed on my Philips Fidelio headset and found it blocked out a lot more noise. With sound running through the iDeaUSA headset, obviously the outside noises are harder to pick up. These are slightly better at blocking outside sound than the Bon Venu Wings of Angel, but at the end of the day know that they do not provide a high level of noise canceling.<br /><br />As far as setting up the headphones goes it worked fairly easily and painless. You simply plug them into a USB port (no need for a sound card), download the software online (they give you the link in the manual), and install it. The software is by CMedia and gives you the ability to adjust the volume of the speakers (you can even stager the volume by making it louder in the left or right earpiece), and mic. With the mic you can set the dB from 23 to -12. You can of course control mic and speaker volume through your OS too, but it’s nice to have specific control in the application provided by the manufacturer. Now here’s where I’m a little less enthusiastic. While the software gets these headphones working quickly and easily, it is lacking in features and customization. For instance there isn’t an equalizer like you get with the SteelSeries Engine or Corsair utility. This means you can’t set it up for differing gaming instances, such as FPS and RTS. There is an option for profiles, but it didn’t work for me. When clicking the “+” icon all I got was an error saying something about having a profile with that same setting. Well, how does it know when it won’t even let me create a new profile?? By default the headset is set to the Hi-Fi profile. This is the only one you’re going to want to use. There’s “Movie Mode” which makes you feel like you are in a tunnel and “Music Mode” which makes you feel like you are in twenty tunnels at once. Clicking the manual icon does nothing. This app is a bit raw and in need of improvement; feels more like a Beta than a final release.<br /><br />Now, if you read other reviews you will see people say bad things about the mic. Here’s the thing about the mic: from what I can tell it was developed to cut out background noises. One reviewer mentions it was too loud and another said it was like talking through a towel. The first issue is easily solved by lowering the dB in the software, but the second issue is a fair concern. I fired up Audacity and recorded my voice, testing a wide range of volume -- from whispering to yelling. My voice was clear and easy to hear, but it was muffled. Very muffled. I did the same test with my Bon Venu Wings of Angel headphones and had entirely different results. The voice was crisp and clear, but with more background noise and whooshing sound. Part of the problem with the iDeaUSA headset is that the mic is short, thus doesn’t sit directly in front of your mouth. I get that, since the mic doesn’t rotate back and out of the way, keeping it short helps to keep it from being a nuisance should you not be using it. But it also means you’re voice isn’t projecting into it directly. I really wish the software had the ability to change the tone of the mic. I wish the user could choose which preference they prefer: background noise elimination or clarity of speech. Unfortunately you are stuck with it the one way. This is indeed the biggest weakness of the iDeaUSA headset.<br /><br />I was tempted to give these headphones 5-stars based on the impressive sound quality for the price, but with the mic issue and software limitations I just can’t pull the trigger. 4-stars it is; still an overall good buy.", "ParentASIN": "B01BZNXXEK", "Timestamp": 1465231330000, "ItemName": "Gaming Headset, iDeaUSA Virtual 7.1 Surround Sound Gaming Headphones with Mic, Noise Cancelling USB Over Ear Gamer Headset Vibration Volume Control LED Light for PC Laptop", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 3.0, "RatingCount": 18, "Price": null, "Categories": ["Video Games", "PC", "Accessories", "Headsets"], "Description": "The iDeaUSA Gaming Headset features 40mm neodymium magnet drivers for high-quality audio and enhanced bass, along with virtual 7.1 surround sound for an immersive gaming experience.

The pair I have been using up to this point is the SteelSeries Siberia 650, which retails for $199.99. But my motherboard has a flaw that shuts the computer off whenever any static electricity is picked up, so every time I touched the metal band of the Siberia 650 it triggered the issue. I paid too much for the stupid motherboard and it’s out of warrantee, so I’m not about to mess around with replacing it, yet. Because of this, I figured I’d give this budget Bon Venu headset a shot, and I’m glad I did.<br /><br />Since it plugs into the audio and mic ports rather than a USB receiver (which the Siberia 650 does), and since there’s no metal surface, I’ve had no issues of static feedback to the MB. One problem solved.<br /><br />Now, is there a loss in quality from the Siberia 650 to the Bon Venu? Yes, there is, but surprisingly not as much as I expected. I was impressed with how well the Bon Venu sounded. Where it does falter a bit when it comes to more crisp audio reproduction, it does a great job with bass. Particularly punchy bass; the kind you’d get from explosions and music like Techno. You can also blast the volume beyond safe hearing levels without any distortion or rattling. This was much more than I expected from a budget gaming headset.<br /><br />Keep in mind that these are open back headphones, which means there is little noise cancelling. With them on your head (but no sound running through them) you can pretty much hear all the noises around you, and even those in the distance. This can be a good thing if you want to hear what’s going on, such as in an office or in a house where family needs to interrupt you (assuming you want them to). But it can be bad if you have noisy neighbors that you want to block out, or a spouse that vacuums right when you’re trying to sneak up on that annoying sniper in COD. That said, you can block out some noises just by having sound running through the headset; your ears will be more focused on what’s closest to them. The louder, the better, obviously.<br /><br />The headset is very lightweight and comfortable on the head. There’s soft padding on the headband for extra support, and the padding on the ear cups are soft and unobtrusive. The height adjustments work well too, simply sliding up and down the wire shaft.<br /><br />The mic sits a couple inches away from your mouth, even when bent inward, which is a little unusual since most mics sit closer. Surprisingly it still picks up the voice chat audio fairly well. Better than the close-mouth mic I had on the Siberia 650. And it does a good job of prioritizing speech over background noises; there’s very little annoying white noise. Like many gaming headsets, the mic swivels up and out of the way should you not need it.<br /><br />The one thing I’m not as fond of is the bulky mic and volume controls that sit 14” down the cord, which essentially rubs just below my chest. When not wearing a shirt, this can be a bit irritating / annoying. I much prefer having the controls on the ear piece, but that’s part of why this is a budget set. At the end of the day, this is a preference rather than a performance issue, so it’s not enough of a negative for me to lower my rating.<br /><br />While these are not wireless, they don’t suffer from the connection issues I’ve experienced with other headsets I’ve owned. Such as the Corsair Vengeance 2100, which had issues when I connected to GoToMeeting; I’d miss half of what people were saying at times (not professional when doing freelance work). This is why I’ve moved away from wireless and into the wired world for headsets, even if it does seem outdated. While there is a wire that can be annoying and in the way at times, the audio and chat signals do not stagger or suffer loss of quality. So for me, it’s a fair trade.<br /><br />Overall, these headphones are comfortable, sound great and look good (IMHOP). They are a great value for the price, and I would highly recommend them to all my gaming buddies.", "ParentASIN": "B01DJ93AJG", "Timestamp": 1462391378000, "ItemName": "Bon Venu Wings of Angel Headphones Stereo Bass Surround Sound for Music Gamer Noise Isolating Comfy Cushion HI-FI Gaming Headset with Flexible Microphone Color Black", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 3.4, "RatingCount": 16, "Price": null, "Categories": ["Video Games", "PC", "Accessories", "Headsets"], "Description": "Sure!

I was very satisfied with this charger regardless of the handful of negative reviews -- mostly speaking toward the difficulty of seating the controllers properly. While it did take a bit to get a system down, for me this wasn’t a concern. And owning it for nearly three years I could say it has held up to the test of time. Why do I mention this on a review for the Energizer 2X Extra Life Charge system? Because I have found the Energizer brand for PS4 chargers to be reliable. Also, because, unlike the PDP Energizer 2X Charging Station, this one has absolutely no issues with seating the controllers. There is no micro USB plug to align the controller with on the charging dock, instead, you plug the recharge pack into the USB port on the controller, and from there the pack itself is what connects the controller to the dock. Because of this, the controller [with pack] sets down into the charging dock without the need for perfect alignment or wiggling to fit. It’s quick and simple.<br /><br />The only real concern I had with this system was with the extra weight the recharge pack would add to the controller. I was glad to discover the pack only weighs 29 grams when fully charged. To give you an idea, the controller itself weighs 220 grams. So adding 29 on top of this is barely noticeable. Nor did it get in the way. In fact, the pack didn’t negatively affect my gaming experience whatsoever.<br /><br />While I still prefer the aesthetic look of my original PDP Energizer 2X Charging Station, I like the functionality and extend battery life of the Energizer 2X Extra Life Charge System.

I’ve owned a Sega Genesis, SNES, PS1/2/3/4, PSP, Gameboy, Wii and WiiU, gaming PC, and even went so far as to backdate old systems like the Intellivision, Atari Lynx and original Pong. That said, oddly enough, I’ve never played an Assassin's Creed game. This review is coming from a first-time player of the series, but not a noob when it comes to gaming.<br /><br />As of this review, I’m about 20% through the game. My early impression was to compare the gameplay to Styx and Splinter Cell, but as I got further I thought of two other games it fits better: Far Cry (3 & 4) and inFAMOUS.<br /><br />As with inFAMOUS, you scale buildings, run across rooftops and liberate territories. You also earn skill points to level up your characters. Several of the game mechanics for character movement were very similar, such as climbing and jumping from high places. Now add in Far Cry where you search for treasure chests, enter restricted areas, disable alarms, free captives, craft items, commandeer vehicles (aka carriages), and execute a multitude of side missions.<br /><br />Also relative to Far Cry are the many quirks and bugs, such as water buckets moving on their own, characters missing the upper half of their body, and strange objects randomly floating across the screen. Similarly, the enemy goons all look the same with only a handful of repetitive character designs. That said, there are many of the plusses too, such as the elaborate settings, beautiful landscapes and impressive world scale.<br /><br />In the beginning, I made the mistake of tackling the story in a very guided manner. I ran through the tutorials and reached checkpoints as quickly as possible, passing by any obstacle in my way. Because of this, I didn’t get pulled into the settings or storyline. After a while, I realized I needed to tackle the game less like Uncharted and treat it more like Skyrim. Basically, I slowed down -- took my time, inspected buildings, listened to crowd dialogue, read wall posters, explored the historical characters and settings, checked character profiles and tackled more of the minute tasks such as searching for treasure chests and freeing children. Slowing down my pacing gave me a deeper level of enjoyment; the game become more about exploration than a guided tour.<br /><br />At times, the controls felt jumpy. For instance, occasionally I performed an execution where the camera panned away from my character and I could barely see what was going on. The need for combining keys for common actions messed me up in the beginning as well, and I more than once ended up jumping up a wall when I intended to leap at an enemy instead. But the longer I played the game, the better I got at the mechanics; and thus they were less of an issue.<br /><br />Unlike Far Cry and inFAMOUS, you switch between two different characters. This helps to keep the story fresh, but it also means you are leveling up two different people. A few times I swore I had already gotten such-and-such an ability, only to realize it was on the other character. Even though the leveling up isn’t shared between Evie and Jacob Frye, thankfully the items you purchase are (except for items like Jacob’s belt, which Evie doesn’t use). If you buy guns and brass knuckles, both can use them [assuming their level is high enough].<br /><br />I was a little disjointed in the story when the gameplay went from 1868 to a modern day cut-scene, but I get that’s part of a larger picture to the story. My biggest annoyance is with the policemen, who are just poorly programmed. They ignore someone getting pickpocketed, but attack you when you tackle the thief. You get wrongly attacked by Blighters, the police join in and attack you too. A Blighter kills someone, the police go after you just because you are nearby. Figuring out their role has been somewhat of an annoyance to me.<br /><br />Apart from that, I’m getting into this game and liking it more and more.

The plastic build feels a little cheap, but that's part of what keeps the weight down. I found I could wear them for hours without feeling uncomfortable. They do feel a bit bulky when laying my head against a pillow, but didn't get in the way when wearing glasses -- never once did the headphones press the earpieces into my skin. They fit snugly without adding excess pressure against the skull.<br /><br />It's important to note that these are open back headphones; not designed for noise isolation. If you want to put these bad boys on and tune out the world, look elsewhere. Logically, SteelSeries made these open back with the PS4 in mind; designing them for people who want chat audio alone. This means you can put both earcups on and still hear the external audio (eg. game music and sound effects) put out by your TV or stereo speakers. Think of it as having chatting internal and gaming music/sound external. You can hear your buddy cursing in your ear after you got in a good headshot, but only have the sound of the sniper rifle available for outside ears. A good privacy feature without muting your 1000-watt sub-woofer (assuming you have one).<br /><br />That said, know that you can set them to pump in both chat AND game audio. This isn't set on the PS4 by default, however. You'll need to go into your settings and click on \"Devices.\" From there, select \"Audio Devices.\" Under \"Output to Headphones\" select \"All Audio.\" Now you have full privacy with both chat and game audio, but keep in mind you will hear outside noises when the sound output is low.<br /><br />I found the audio cable to be a bit long for hooking into the PS4 controller. I'm a 6' man with pretty long arms, and there was still a fair amount of slack between my ears and my extended arms (where I hold the controller). This extra bit of slack in the cable was slightly annoying as it bunched up and got in the way. I'd have preferred the audio cable to be removable/replaceable so that I could swap it out with the exact length that suites me, but as it is the cable is permanently attached to the left ear-cup.<br /><br />I do have a PS3, but honestly didn't bother to set this headset up with it. Unlike the PS4 where you can plug the headset into the controller, you'll need to find a convenient way to plug them into your audio system. For most people this will require an audio extension cable. Which, to me, is kinda annoying and a bit outdated.<br /><br />In reality, this headset isn't limited to either the PS3 or PS4 gaming system. Any device with a standard audio jack can be hooked up. And since there's a mic, you can even use them with your smartphone for phone calls. I tested them on the PS4, Wii U, Laptop, Chromebook and smartphone (LG G4).<br /><br />The sound quality is actually pretty good as long as your device is setup with the right drivers. I had a laptop running Windows 10 and the audio it outputted was flat, but I fixed that by updating the drivers. There is deep bass (considering the open back) and somewhat crisp highs. I say somewhat crisp because I noticed a few notes that just don't hit it as clearly as Bose headphones I tried. That said, for the price range, the sound quality is quite good. I did notice some popping distortion on loud explosions when hooked to the Wii U, but not on the PS4.<br /><br />Overall, I like these headphones for the price range. I did noticed that sweat builds up in the earcups pretty fast, so I recommend avoiding any sort of physical activity while wearing them (or time spent out in the sun).", "ParentASIN": "B00YY3ODTS", "Timestamp": 1441207845000, "ItemName": "SteelSeries Siberia X800 Wireless Gaming Headset with Dolby 7.1 Surround Sound for Xbox One, Xbox 360", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 3.9, "RatingCount": 199, "Price": null, "Categories": [], "Description": "Sure!

As long as you have a device with an optical port, the audio portion of the headset should work (the microphone is a different story). For example, I plugged the PX4 into my PC's sound card and it performed just as well as when plugged into my PS4. Keep in mind that the USB cables are for power, not connectivity.<br /><br />On the PX4 wireless transmitter, there's an optical \"out\" as well as \"in\". Because of this, I was able to plug my PS4 into the optical \"in\" port, then plug another cable in the \"out\" that went into my Yamaha receiver. That way, I can have the PS4 play through my speaker system AND headphones. I say AND because, technically, you can do both at once. There's no switching back and forth. If I want just the headphones active, I simply turn my receiver off; and vise versa.<br /><br />The wireless transmitter signal isn't as strong as I'd like it to be. I plugged it into the computer in my office, then walked out to my couch. Even with the door open, the signal broke in and out. Since I planned to use this for PC gaming with my home theater projector -- and I didn't want to move my computer -- I purchased a 25' optical cable and ran it through the ceiling, which did the trick. That said, most people will have the transmitter in the same room as their gaming system; it does fine for that.<br /><br />Note that I use the PSX on my PC with the extended optical cable, but tested it fully on the PS4. For regular PS4 use, I have Turtle Beach's Call of Duty: Ghosts Ear Force Phantom, even though it says it's made for the Xbox 360 (I know, crazy, right?). The PSX headset itself feels a little cheap when compared with the Phantom and my [[ASIN:B007ZZ6OW6 Corsair Vengeance 2000 Wireless 7.1 Gaming Headset (CA-9011115-NA)]]. That said, it's lighter on my head compared with the Corsair and the Phantom costs around twice as much, so keep that in mind.<br /><br />The optical cable that comes with both the PX4 and Phantom is extremely thin. I suggest investing in something like the [[ASIN:B004LSNF04 Mediabridge Toslink Cable (6 Foot) - Optical Digital Audio Cable]], which should provide better sound quality. On a positive note, Turtle Beach does give you a really long USB charging cable. The idea is if your headset battery runs out of power, you can plug it in and still be able to play at a distance (something most bluetooth devices don't allow).<br /><br />Another thing to consider is that there are two items to power. (1) The wireless transmitter, and (2) The headset -- when charging. That means there are two USB cables that need to be plugged in. On the PS4, there are only two ports, so you have to use up both. Don't expect to use the same charging cable as your controllers either; they use micro USB whereas the PX4 uses mini (same as PS3, though). And because the ports are in front of the PS4, it makes for an ugly, octopus-like setup. So I picked myself up a powered USB hub and stuffed it behind my media center. That way I can power the transmitter and charge the headphones while keeping the cables hidden. Too bad Turtle Beach doesn't provide an AC adapter themselves.<br /><br />The sound quality on the headphones is pretty good, and there are 6 different angle presets, depending on the type of game you are playing. In addition, you can connect a bluetooth device to listen to music or chat with your friends over the phone. But don't bother trying to connect the headphones to the PS4 via bluetooth. For whatever reason, Sony doesn't support stereo headsets; an update I expected to see on the fourth generation console. And right now the microphone isn't supported via PS4's bluetooth either (you have to wire it to the controller). That said, the microphone IS supported on the PS3.<br /><br />PS4, PS3, PSX, PC . . . Oy, so many similar sounding acronyms; hopefully I haven't lost you at this point, but I wanted to give a detailed account of different uses. Overall, this headset is pretty good.

The addition of Charlie is good, but I feel that the character of Briggs is unnecessary; there's already enough tension between Grimm and Sam Fisher.

You won't feel you're breaking your PS4 Pro or the hub. And it sits securely and elegantly on the PS4's front. Very nice design.<br /><br />It, however, does take up both of the USB 3.1 ports on the front of your PS4 Pro -- and it gives back only 1 USB 3.0 port. The other 4 ports on the hub are only USB 2. Of course, you still have 1 additional USB 3.1 port on the rear of the PS4 Pro itself. The way the  hub works is like those attachable hubs for MacBook Pros: always taking up both ports for the benefit of extension.<br /><br />For my family's PS4 Pro gaming needs, this hub is actually fine. We attach a Logitech wireless gaming headphones' remote unit to one of the ports, we also attach a wired keyboard and 2 charging cables. We don't have a need for the USB 3.0 port yet, as we use the rear 3.1 port for our external 2TB hard drive. But this does save us from having to constantly plugging and unplugging USB devices.<br /><br />If you have more than 3 USB devices you constantly use with your PS4 Pro, or more than 2 if you don't want to reach for the rear USB port, this can be a valuable accessory.

It wasn't until I started seeing media for The Witcher 2 that my interest was piqued due to the crazy good review *that* game was getting. I wanted to play 2, but the completionist in me required me to play the first one, ESPECIALLY so once I found out the first one's save game imports to impact the second game's story.<br /><br />I'm glad I waited.<br /><br />From what I've heard, numerous bugs and glitches were resolved in the ensuing years, the voicework was completely redone (and I shudder to think of how bad it was before, because even now i wouldn't call it &#34;good&#34;), and a number of new character models were added (again, there are still too many recycled faces in this game, but I hear it was even worse before).<br /><br />So this sounds bad,right? Not So! Yes the game has its faults. It's definitely not a AAA title, and you can tell. But despite the terrible voice work, duplicate character models, & wonky animation, this is a game with a deep immersive world that will suck you in for hours at a time, with an intricate story that for the most part is paced well (except chapter two, which is a struggle to put it mildly). My only piece of advice to the programmers: Next to escort missions, making a primary mission require you to find ten of ANYTHING through constant backtracking to advance the game should be at the top of the list of things not to do in a game. As a secondary quest? MAYBE...<br /><br />But warts and all, this is a great game, and anyone who's interested in playing TW2 or the upcoming TW3 for pc, would be well advised to check out the original.

Tron Evolution delivers in that department despite suffering from some serious Uncanny Valley at times.<br /><br />Tron Evolution is a prequel of sorts to the recent movie Tron:Legacy, and serves to explain some of the backstory elements that take place between the first movie and this one. For fans of the series, this is a nice bonus.<br /><br />As a game, Tron delivers but doesn't exceed. The game is kind of a 50/50 split between Prince-of-Persia style platforming and 3d-brawler combat. Everything looks stunning, and once you get the hang of it, the gameplay is fun enough, and at times surprisingly challenging, but there are issues. The control layout is a little weird, and there are things you have to do to pull off moves that are non-intuitive.  The camera is bordering on a disaster but not quite one. Some of the wall jump obstacles seem arbitrarily difficult. And the game is EXTREMELY linear. like, even when you're running around in Tron City, even if there are doors to areas or people around, you can't open the doors or talk to the people - they're just decorations and you really only ever have one way to go. This is an issue for a lot of games but in this instances it's not disguised particularly well at all and therefore is even more glaring.<br /><br />The upgrade system is interesting and for being essentially a one-weapon combat system the game gets a fair amount of mileage out of it, I've definitely played worse. Controls again take some getting used to, but are fairly fluid and understandible once you get the hang of it.<br /><br />The voice acting and story are stellar, and there are some Tron favorites in here (Bruce Boxlietner, for one, and Olivia Wilde, too). While Jeff Bridges did not voice Flynn or Clu, the guy they had to do it nailed it so well you almost can't tell the difference, it's really spectacular - I had to look it up to make sure it wasn't actually Jeff. Unfortunately, as I said the face models in this game are pretty terrible. They LOOK like the characters they're supposed to be enough, but look extremely dead and uncanny-valleyish. Some are worse than others - the Clu/Flynn characters look particularly bad, while Tron looks much better, though, and the player character has no problems because he's always wearing a helmet, however.<br /><br />In the end this game is OK. it's definitely worth picking up if you're a Tron fan, especially at a reduced price. If you have the choice, I would recommend the PS3 version for the 3D capability.

Given that this is a movie tie-in my expectations were pretty low, anything tolerable would've been acceptable but I was pretty surprised about how good this game actually was during the hour I played it. The target audience is definitely under 10 which makes sense given the subject matter, but despite that surprisingly few corners were cut (from what I saw).<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- Solid gameplay. This is a fairly straight-forward 3rd person platformer.  The player can play as Woody, Buzz, or Jessie and has a fairly standard set of moves (run, double-jump, throw balls, charge, etc), which are appropriate for the type of non-violent style of game this is. Aside from the story mode, which I hear is somewhat short, there is an open-world environment called \"Woody's Roundup\" which strikes me a little like Animal Crossing meets Red Dead Redemption. Yeah, Really. The things you can do are all fairly non-threatening (paint a house, mine for gold, etc), but varied and interesting. There's a lot to keep the little ones (and even the parents) entertained for a while, and the gameplay is fairly tight.<br /><br />- great voice acting: A combination of voice talent from the movie and excellent sound-alikes make this game really feel like an extention of the film series. The game takes place after the events of Toy Story 3 and in the hour that I played I encountered Hamm, Rex & that blue Triceratops that Kristen Schaal (of Daily Show fame) voices, all voiced by the same talent from the movies. Woody and Buzz are not voiced by Tom Hanks or Tim Allen, but the sound-alikes are amazing, I really wasn't immediately sure if they were fake or real. Overall an excellent job.<br /><br />- gentle difficulty/easy to learn. As a game primarily meant for children, this game is not that hard. the penalty for dying is basically restarting where you died, and along the way there are cues to hit R2 for hints at challenging spots, so it's very easy to figure out what you're supposed to do next. My 2 year old obviously is not going to be playing this game yet (although he likes to watch), but by the time he's 4 he will probably be able to handle it, and in the case of the Woody's Roundup area he could probably have a lot of fun just moving Woody/Buzz/Jessie around the map and can do so without fear of getting stuck.  Despite the easy learning curve, the game isn't without challenge, and there are a few tough spots and enough interesting things to do to keep me (the parent) occupied.<br /><br />- I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there were options to configure the camera controls exactly the way I wanted. In a game like this, meant for kids, I kinda wasn't expecting to find the ability to invert all the Y-axis controls but nonetheless they were there. Kudos to the devs for this.<br /><br />CONS: This is a limited-budget movie tie in. Not surprisingly there are a few issues.<br /><br />- Graphics are below average. You would think with the movie's art style would be easy to duplicate on a modern videogame system, given the general lack of detail.  Despite this the graphics are REALLY simplistic, and there are polygons noticeable in places they shouldn't be, like Hamm's nose. in 2010, there is really no reason why a featureless cylinder can't be easily reproduced without showing facets, but in Toy Story 3 the polygon count is REALLY low. On the plus side, there are no frame-rate drops, but given the way the graphics look, if there were it would be inexcusable. Overall it's not horrible but they lose points here.<br /><br />- Granted I've only gotten an hour into the game but it looks like only Disney-specific toys are in. No Potato Head, no Trolls, no Barbie. Not entirely suprised but given the fact that Potato Head is/was a main character, and the trolls make an appearance in the train scene from the movie in the beginning of the game, it's a little disappointing.<br /><br />- Prospector's voice is all wrong. No Fraiser :(<br /><br />- I hear the game is short, although given the way kids are that's not likely to be a major problem.<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Overall I'd say this game is surprisingly good. After trying it out on PS3 Demo, I'm going to pick it up. As a parent finding a game I can play that is both OK for my kid to see (i.e. no Demon Souls), something he doesn't mind watching AND not boring as hell to play, this is a godsend.

When Peacewalker came out I got my first taste of what that could really be like as the MG3-style gameplay was -mostly- captured in Peacewalker. But this, my friends, is the real thing.<br /><br />MGS3 on the vita is a sight to behold. Gameplay, graphics, story - it's all there. Some changes to the controls were necessary due to the lack of L2/L3/R2/R3 and touch sensitive face buttons, but it's been mostly remapped well enough although as its been stated earlier, aiming rifles and the like in first-person hasn't gotten any easier. I actually like the touch screen item selection better, it makes a lot of sense, but the touch screen cure menu could have been implemented more naturally. As it is, you need to touch the wound, then touch the item  you want to use, then press the up button on the D-pad(?) - It took me 10 minutes and listening to the tutorial from Para-Medic twice to catch what I was missing.<br /><br />Incidentally - it was a nice touch to get the original voice actors to re-record all the tutorial sections in the game that changed, but the matching of old recordings to new wasn't perfect, and you can hear where it was done if you listen. Not a huge distraction, but it's there, like a bad f-bomb overdub in a prime-time TV movie.<br /><br />This is the Subsistence version of MGS3 as well, so as a bonus you also get the original MSX versions of Metal Gear 1 & 2, so what you're really getting is FOUR games, not two. These games are fantastic in their own right, but being 8-bit NES style games, they're kind of irritating to play on a full-size console, but PERFECT for a portable. These two games could be released on their own on the PSN and people would probably buy them, so bundling them in with MGS2 & 3 is a nice touch.<br /><br />You'll notice I'm not really reviewing MGS2 yet - I haven't played it. But if it's as good as the MGS3 port, it won't disappoint. While these games aren't the killer-app the Vita needs, they really show how a true console experience can be had with a Vita. As a parent, my PS3 spends more time collecting dust than playing games anymore, but having a portable unit like a Vita, along with the ability to play for a few minutes, pause, and come back to the gameplay in a moment works a lot better for me.

With interest peaking with regards to the new Mechwarrior Online, I figured I'd revisit the old Mechwarrior games.<br /><br />By far this game is a mixed bag. When Mechwarrior 2 mercenaries first game out in 1996, that game was considered a real improvement over the previous iteration, the resource management meta-game was new to the series, and the game engine itself was revamped (and MUCH more challenging for systems of the time to run). Believe it or not, that game was a \"Crysis\" of its day.<br /><br />The same cannot be said for Mechwarrior 4:Mercenaries.  Rather than push the limits of the engine, the opposite tack was taken. Yes there is a mercenaries meta-game attached and it is fun, but the underlying mech combat engine has not been improved at all (in fact the following criticisms can be applied to all the mechwarrior 4 games). In fact, it's arguably uglier than ever.  The silly primary colors of the mechs does not fit the previous art style of the franchise well at all and was a major disappointment. The gameplay is faster and more arcadey, for better or worse, less 'sim-like'.<br /><br />Changes were made to the mech customization rules in the mechwarrior 4 line which have been controversial, throwing out criticals that can be filled with any equipment to that of 'hard-points', where only weapons of a certain type can be put in specific hard-points. This particular change I can appreciate, and it does add tactical variety beyond raw mech tonnage. In Mechwarrior 4, two different model mechs, while having the same weight class, can have totally different hard-point loadouts which will make them very different mechs. Additionally, Something like a Mad Cat, which has two big LRM pods on its shoulders, will actually HAVE LRMs int those crit points, or nothing at all. No stealth lasers in your LRM pods.<br /><br />Unfortunately the praise ends there. The game looks cartoony and not in a good way: the lack of shading and light effects present even in MW3, and generally low-level textures make the game look raw and ugly, and the game engine definitely doesn't challenge even the hardware of its day, although the framerate is always stellar. Worse, whatever Microsoft did programming the engine makes it VERY hard to get working on modern machines, or even contemporary machines with modern software. The game does not run at all in a 64 bit environment, and even on a circa 2005 era Windows XP machine, I have to disable joystick support altogether to keep the game from crashing to desktop, and before you ask, yes I have all my drivers up to date. If anything, that is the problem - I suspect something in the MW4 game engine does not play nice with the current flavors of DirectInput. Fortunately one can work around this limitation by using keyboard mapping software but not having true analog axis control is kind of a letdown.<br /><br />Despite all these criticisms Mechwarrior 4: Mercenaries is not a bad game, it's just potentially part of the reason there was no Mechwarrior 5 (MW:O notwithstanding). If you're new to the Mechwarrior series, I suggest picking up Mechwarrior 3 instead. That is the high point of the series in my opinion, with the best looking graphics (despite being a few years older), a better, more sim-like 'feel', and a mechlab that is based on the original Battletech rule set.  That game has its own set of flaws (notably the horrendous friendly AI), but overall was a more fun game IMO.<br /><br />MW4:Mercs is a game for completionists only. 3 stars (out of 5).<br />April 3rd, 2012.", "ParentASIN": "B00006IJMS", "Timestamp": 1333476820000, "ItemName": "Mech Warrior 4: Mercenaries - PC", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 3.5, "RatingCount": 69, "Price": null, "Categories": ["Video Games", "PC", "Games"], "Description": "Engage in 40 missions across various planetary systems, collecting C-Bills as both currency and a measure of your Mech's balance.

Firing the bow can be attempted either like it always has with the right stick, or more weirdly by pressing the spot you want the arrow to go on the screen, which seems like a good idea, but can lead to some weird effects, especially if you have fat fingers.  You can also aim the bow (or just first person mode) by moving the vita around itself via the gyros, but if you're like me and have the right button axes reversed, this mapping follows into gyro movement and makes completely no sense - you tilt the device up and the screen view goes down. What was really needed was separate options for this control mapping and the right stick FPS mapping. minus points for lazyness.<br /><br />This isn't the only touch screen weirdness either. The save file select function is accomplished via touch, but ONLY this - no other menus are touch enabled - which is completely rediculous. This is the kind of thing that should be all or nothing, otherwise, it's just confusing.<br /><br />Gameplay itself is just fine however. The framerate is smooth and there are no noticable changes beyond what was already done in Sigma, so those of you familiar with that game will be able to jump right in and kick ass. I have a slight suspicion, though not anything confirmed, that the difficulty was toned down a notch - I'm currently playing on 'normal' and find my self blowing through battles that would normally be a lot harder - say for instance the motorcycle guys in Tairon - seem much easier than they used to be. On the other hand, Spider Clan ninjas are just as hard as ever, so maybe not.<br /><br />Speaking of gameplay -  for all you wimps out there there is a wimp mode called \"hero mode\", which is laughable. Unlike earlier iterations of \"ninja dog\" mode which required you sucking a lot before it was unlocked and came along with constant insults from Ayane, \"hero\" mode is accessible from the start and basically makes you invincible. After your health gets below a certain level, you basically auto-block and have unlimited ninpo, which removes nearly all challenge from the game.<br /><br />There is also a hard mode which I haven't tried yet, and I suspect an \"ultimate\" mode as there was in all previous versions of the game, but as I'm still in chapter six, I can't comment yet.<br /><br />Overall, this is an average port of an excellent game. I can't think of too many people who haven't played the original ninja gaiden, but if you're one of them, this is an excellent time to give it a shot. For those of you who have played it and want something to tide you over until NGIII, or want some quality NG on a portable, this is where to get it. The only complaint at this point would be the price, but soon enough that will likely drop.<br /><br />4 Stars - minus one for stupid touch UI decisions.", "ParentASIN": "B006NYWLLI", "Timestamp": 1331054497000, "ItemName": "Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus - PlayStation Vita", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.4, "RatingCount": 147, "Price": null, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation Vita", "Games"], "Description": "The PlayStation Vita introduces innovative features like the rear touch pad for enhancing Ninpo and motion controls for aiming.

Once you start, you can't stop.", "Content": "There are few games on the market these days quite like Dark Souls, other than the game's spiritual successor Demon's Souls. This game combines stunning graphics, challenging gameplay, a deep game mechanic, and an interesting (if minimal) story, and combines it with some of the best (when working) multiplayer you can get on a console. The game is not flawless, but as of the latest update (1.05) it's pretty darn close.<br /><br />First, a little background: For those who don't know, Demon's Souls (the games predecessor) came out on the playstation in 2009 to little fanfare, but caught on like wildfire becuase of the incredible multiplayer. The game straddled the line between an old-school Zelda type experience (and I'm talking NES Zelda, not Ocarina of time), and a modern MMORPG. How is this possible? Well for starters you were online pretty much all the time. You were constantly seeing 'ghosts' of other people playing the game, and when you were in human form were constantly under the threat of being 'invaded' by another player looking to steal your body for their own use. If you died, the game got HARDER, as you lost half your max HP while in soul form, among other things - but in this situation you could drop a summon sign to be summoned by other players to help them beat a level (theirby earning your body back), or you could be the invader and kill some other hapless player, thereby taking their body for yourself.  You could leave little hints on the ground for other players to find, but there was no in-game voice chat - and this was done on purpose.  A lot of the challenge involved finding things out on your own, but beyond that, hearing some 10 year old over the intercom would certainly ruin the immersion, and I think the developers were well aware of that.<br /><br />Did I mention if you died you lost all your accumulated unspent XP? You had one chance to reclaim them if you could get back to your bloodstain, but if you died again, they were gone. Yeah this game was unforgiving.<br /><br />Anyway, back to Dark Souls. In a nutshell, Dark Souls is Demon's Souls's(?) unofficial sequal. It uses the same basic game engine, borrows heavily from the Demon's Souls look & feel, and similar multiplayer, although this has been modified, sometimes for the better, and sometimes for worse, as we will get to in a minute. For various reasons Sony ended up owning the IP rights to \"Demon's Souls\", so when From Software went to develop a sequal (which they wanted to release on both the PS3 and the 360) they had to start from scratch with the IP.  The result is a game that has a totally different world and story, with a darker, grittier feel than the original (if that's possible).<br /><br />Gameplay:<br />The combat is unforgiving, but very fair. There are litterally hundreds of different weapons, and although they more or less fit into six or seven different catagories, each one has its own quirks that make them all feel unique. One of the nice things about this game is that there is definitely no 'best weapon', as effectiveness has as much to do with your own skill as it does with the weapon itself. All weapons can be upgraded throughout the game, and crafting better weapons becomes a major part of the game. This is another area where the game takes on the MMO aspect as the combinations of weapons & armor, and how one upgrades each, can lead to literally hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of permutations, so there are many meaningful ways to customize your character.<br /><br />As with demon's souls, you're online most of the time. In fact, in order to play offline  you have to jump through a few hoops, as the default mode is online.  Online mode is seemless however, there are no lobbies (that you can see, anyway), and matching happens more or less in the background as it would in an MMO. brough back from Demon's Souls are player ghosts, so you can see when an area has activity in it, as well as the co-op and invasion mechanics. While in human form, you are constantly at risk of being invaded, although this happens much less frequently than In Demon's Souls as there are few hoops that need to be jumped through in order to perform an invasion. Unfortunately, there are those that have abuse the invasion mechanic and tend to invade low-level players early on in the game with super powerful gear which can lead to a lot of griefing. It is reccommended new players play through the first through areas of the game as \"Hollows\", or undead, so as not to be invaded and constantly harrased. Fortunately, the griefing seems to be limited to the Undead Burg & Parish levels, and after that, invasions tend to me more or less on even ground.<br /><br />The gameplay is -VERY- difficult at first, but once you get the hang of it, becomes immensely addictive and rewarding. Fortunately, when you are in human form, one thing  you can do is summon other players via signs left on the ground to help you through whatever area you are in. If you are in hollow form, you cannot summmon other players, but you can be summoned yourself, and successfully helping a player beat a boss character earns you \"humanity\" which you can use to restore your body, among other things.<br /><br />This game has literally hundreds of hours of replay value. For completionists, you are looking at AT LEAST 3 playthroughs to get all the trophies/achievements. And some of the rarer items are incredibly difficult to get without a lot of luck and patience (if you ever come across a Symbol of Avarice, consider yourself very lucky).<br /><br />So if this game is so great, why not give it a perfect score?<br />Well, it IS great, but it's not perfect. First of all, even though this is probably my favorite game to date, and a game I've invested well over 250 hours in and still haven't beaten yet, this game isn't for everyone. As stated before, it's hard at first, and doesn't hold your hand, unlike most other RPGs these days.  This is definitely a thinking man's game, and if you aren't into that, don't bother.<br /><br />The multiplayer is not without its issues. This time around the online component was implemented via lobbies & PTP connections, as opposed to the single server model of Demon's Souls, which unfortunately means you won't nessacerilly see everyone in your game zone at any given time. This is of course problematic for matchmaking. While certain patches have fixed this issue somewhat, there are other issues that still need to be addressed and probably won't be. For example: the \"Gravelord Covenant\", one of the factions you can join, rarely (if ever) works, and furthermore you can aquire the faction rewards simply by farming one specific mob in the game. The object you need to collect to advance rank in this faction is the same object you need to actually engage in multiplayer for the faction, which kind of defeats the purpose of it. there are other issues, like the level matching requirements (or lack thereof in some cases), which can lead to horribly unbalanced fights in certain areas.<br /><br />Overall, this game has everything the fantasic Demon's Souls had to offer, and a great deal more. The game is not perfect, and there is definitely room for improvement in the next iteration, but this is easily one of the best games of 2011, and every hardcore rpg gamer should give this game a spin.", "ParentASIN": "B0050SZ7IC", "Timestamp": 1325627583000, "ItemName": "Dark Souls Collector's Edition - Playstation 3", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.1, "RatingCount": 121, "Price": 219.99, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation 3", "Games"], "Description": "The game features a challenging dark fantasy world that rewards determined players.

Those that go searching generally find out about King's Field, but it is of the opinion of the author of this review that is in fact Shadow Tower, not King's Field directly, that is the direct precursor to the souls games, and in fact appears to be the missing link between the two (as opposed to the more recent Kings Field: The Ancient City)<br /><br />Shadow Tower shares many traits with the souls games - namely - souls which you use to power up different stats.  There is also weapon breakage, a lack of background music (which adds to rather than subtracts from the oppressive atmosphere), Switchable primary and secondary left & right hand equipment, An enormously deep stat & equipment based system, a near total lack of exposition or hand holding, and a brutal difficulty.<br /><br />Many of these traits are shared by the Kings Field games, along with the first person perspective & the slow, deliberate pacing of the game. But it is the genesis of the Souls games seen in the mood and mechanics of this game that give a preview of things to come.<br /><br />Having said that, don't come into this game expecting the Souls games, this game is different. As stated, it's first and foremost a slow, first person, PS1 game, and not a AAA title by any stretch of the imagination.  This game was made using technology that was several years old at the time and showing it.  Despite being a 3D 1st person RPG and the dualshock controller existing at the time this game was released,  the analog sticks are completely unsupported and the control scheme is completely archaic, with strafing and look up/down controlled by the shoulder buttons of all things.  The game becomes dramatically easier for the modern gamer by remapping the controls so that strafing is done on the d-pad, look up/down/left/right is done using the face buttons, and the attack/action/menu buttons are mapped to the shoulder buttons. this provides something of a modern button layout, but take care not to die before you save after you do the remapping, or you'll have to do it all over again! Such is life in the Souls games, or their predecessors.<br /><br />Combat in this game is decidedly tactical for a game that is nominally an FPS-RPG. Managing HP, Stamina, and MP is first and formost, followed secondly by position relative the enemies on the screen. After such considerations the next most important thing is the durability of your equipment, which breaks at the most inopportune times.  The level of detail and pacing in this game is more remenicient of a old-school PC RPG than a console action game.<br /><br />In the end I'd say that this game is not for everyone. it's definitely got an audience, and if you like deep, thoughtful tactical RPGs with a slow pacing and minimal story line but lots of exploration and atmosphere, you will like Shadow Tower. If you like the Souls games, and can adjust to the Kings Field play style, you will also probably like Shadow Tower. If you like Skyrim you will not like Shadow Tower, and if you like Modern Warfare you are probably lost and should just click the back button on your browser.<br /><br />This game gets points for giving a hint of the greatness to come, but it's hard to give this game a general recommendation outside of the specific audience described above.", "ParentASIN": "B000035YAL", "Timestamp": 1322286674000, "ItemName": "Shadow Tower (PlayStation)", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 3.1, "RatingCount": 15, "Price": 249.95, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"], "Description": "Sure!

I'm right handed so this is less of an issue for me, but it's worth pointing out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- USB cable is short - less than 3 feet. It also doesn't charge the mouse (although this is because the mouse uses AA batteries. The end of the mouse is custom-sized to fit into the front of the mouse, so you can't exactly get a generic replacement, and as I said, Razor doesn't offer replacements.<br /><br />- USB is the only way to remap the mouse, so like I said, don't lose the cable.<br /><br />- Doesn't seem like buttons, while configurable, can be mapped to generic DirectX buttons (i.e. \"mouse 4, mouse 5, etc\". Because they CAN be easily remapped to any keyboard buttons or macros, this is more of an inconvenience, but this seems like an oversight to me.<br /><br />- The buttons on the far side of the mouse (the side opposite your thumb) are a little uncomfortable to connect with. Since the mouse is symmetrical, that means you have 2 good buttons and two somewhat hard to reach buttons, not including the standard 2 buttons + scrollwheel.<br /><br />- Neutral: Pricey, but you get what you pay for.

Although I'm an old school Transfan going back to my childhood,  I never really expected this IP to get a decent treatment after the horrendous Bay films (the first one was OK, but the second one was just depressing).  Upon seeing the first trailer for this game and realizing they were going G1 (after a fashion) however, my curiosity was piqued.<br /><br />So I went out and got this game on release for the PS3. Picked up the GS preorder for the Shockwave unlock.  My first impression was \"it takes 5 minutes to verify the build EACH TIME the game loads? uhhhhh not good\".  You read that right. Each time you start the game, before you get to the main menu (but after 3 different FMV videos), the game does a self-check that takes 2-5 minutes to complete. EACH TIME. So that sucks.  OK, so how about the game?<br /><br />So lets get this out of the way first: Peter Cullen: great, as usual. As far as I can tell, no other original voice actors were involved, but in general the level of voice acting was pretty good, and they even went so far as to properly vocode Soundwave's voice.  In general, the characters all felt right, when we saw them on screen during cutscenes. Which, by the way, are the best part of this game.<br /><br />First take on the single player campaign - ok we get to choose from three different transformers each level - level one gives Megatron, Brawl, & Breakdown. I think the choice here is obvious. Megatron is a tank in this game but feels just a wee-bit underpowered for his namesake, but overall, not terrible, although the low max ammo for his fusion cannon was irritating.  2ND stage was decepticon seekers,  Starscream being the obvious choice here, and this time the character felt more appropriate. 3rd level gave the chance to play Soundwave, which felt underpowered again, but this time moreso than Megs - soundwave is a \"scientist\", which gives him a (useless for single player) healing gun, and a weak rifle for his weapon loadout. Fortunately we can pick up different weapons as the level progresses.  Each character has a special ability or two as well, but most of the time it felt like a lost oppurtunity.  Soundwave, for example, could deploy a \"drone\" that is basically a floating machine gun turret.  Obviously, if this had been a cassette robot, that would have been much cooler and could have more or less satisfied the same game mechanic.  Megs' special is a life-sucking attack which would have been cool except it's really hard to judge if you have an enemy in range for it or not, and if you miss, you still expend a charge.  Other characters have completely useless force-push attacks, or marginally useful cloaks.  The hovering ability is useless as it basically locks you in place and makes you an easy target.<br /><br />The transformations here also seem a bit uninspired.  Obviously there is precedent in some choices (making Megatron a tank, for example), but some just feel shoehorned in to fit the gameplay.  Soundwave, for example, turns into some generic hover-vehicle, when it could've been a lot more interesting if he turned into something more creative.  In the cartoon, when he was on cybertron, you saw his trasnformation into something that looked like a streetlamp, but that left a lot to the imagination. Was he some kind of spying device(probably)? what could he do? perhaps he could transform and be rooted, but blend into the scenery while controlling one (or more) cassette robots, or hack defenses, or provide intel.  Sadly, all he does is turn into a cybertronian truck. Blaster doesn't even make an appearance, nor do any of the combiners (in combined form, at any rate). Oh well, there's always next year...<br /><br />And that's about how the game continues.  The banter between characters is entertaining but not anything we haven't heard before, if not for the fact that it does sound fairly authentic.  The problem is for the most part it feels detached from the game itself, like some audio track from an episode of the cartoon semi-randomly overlaid on otherwise silent gameplay.  Speaking of which, the gameplay itself is fairly generic 3rd-person shooter fair, although with a vehicle/transformation mechanic thrown in. It works, but it's not great. The complaints you're hearing elsewhere (generic levels, lack of cover-sticking, infuriating lack of ammo, and my personal pet peeve, unlimited hordes of enemies that don't stop until you advance, which works with low-ammo problem to become even more irritating) are all totally valid and what really keep this game from being a AAA title.  I'll say right now I haven't played the multiplayer too much because frankly its hard to find people playing. The game lobby said each time I was on that there were about 6200 people online, but all the game lobbies were empty.  I had some more luck finding a coop campaign level playing, but it seemed like I was just randomly dropped in some guys level, which I kinda wasn't thrilled with. I'd rather start a level from scratch.<br /><br />So how do I feel about this game? It's OK. Not great, but OK.  A buy for Transformers fans, definately, as the treatment of the source material is the best part about this game (there are a lot of easter eggs for those who know the g1 series well).  It easily ranks as the 2nd best TF game behind the 2004 PS2 game, but if you strip the TF skin, the game is a fairly underwhelming shooter.  While not quite ready for the primetime, there IS a lot of potential here, and hopefully High Moon will get to make a sequel and polish the rough edges.<br /><br />Definately worth a rent, probably worth a buy if you're a big Transformers fan.  Better than the last two TF Movie based games, but not better than the fantastic Armada based PS2 game, whose only flaw was the mysterious lack of humans on Earth.

And has been said often, this game is no cakewalk.  I won't rehash what has been said by the big online reviewers but I would like to add a few thoughts.<br /><br />1st: this game is very much like a modernized old nintendo game, for better & worse.  I would liken it even to Deadly Towers(gasp!), but I mean that in a good way.  You're dropped in an extremely difficult gameworld with almost no introduction, you're character starts out very weak and you need to explore (carefully!) to find some loot that will begin to make you stronger.  Of that loot, there's plenty of it and like games like deadly towers, it's quite colorful.  The customization is very flexible and for those who are willing to play this game A LOT you can get quite powerful.<br /><br />Still, there is limited story & npc interaction, almost no \"role playing\" in the Bioware/Bethesda sort of way, and almost zero hand holding.  You're basically thrown to the wolves (or in this case, demons) and left to figure it out for yourself. For those that are up to the challenge, you're in for a treat.<br /><br />2nd: This game reminds me a lot of a well polished mmorpg played almost entirely by soloing.  The game is almost entirely about the grind - killing enemies, exploring the world, aquiring loot & upgrading your equipment.  The multiplayer content is unique and interesting - much as been said about it elsewhere, but suffice it to say that it is enjoyable once you get your head wrapped around how it works.<br /><br />One last thing: I don't think this game is that hard, really, once you get the hang of it.", "ParentASIN": "B002KAS4OW", "Timestamp": 1262024405000, "ItemName": "Demon's Souls - PS3 [Digital Code]", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.8, "RatingCount": 2529, "Price": null, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation 3", "Games"], "Description": "The game merges action and RPG elements, allowing players to engage in combat and magic while offering extensive multiplayer features that enhance the single-player experience.

There are also six challenge sets to attempt in challenge mode.<br /><br />There is no time limit, but some sets require you to fill a purple bar within a certain amount of time.  I'm not a particularly quick player, but I didn't find this to be horribly difficult (though I'm still struggling to do the one-minute goal in challenge mode).  There are power-ups that can be purchased with money earned as you progress through the game, and these prove very helpful in the final sets.<br /><br />How to get all the eggs:  you won't get them all the first time through - I got 24 of 32, I think.  I had to play four complete games in adventure mode to get the last one.  I don't believe the eggs can be collected in quick play or challenge modes, and the eggs don't start to turn up until the 15th set or so.  To skip the story cuts (to be honest, the story isn't all that great the first time through), click anywhere on the screen.  A message will come up telling you to click again to skip the cut.

I don't just want to reiterate what others have said. I'll do my best to be original. First off, I loved Uncharted 1. It was a great mixture of third person cover shooter and Prince Of Persia style platforming.<br />Along with a great story, it had excellent voice acting and gorgeous graphics that went head to head with the likes of Gears Of War. To say that Uncharted 2 has surpassed it's predecessor is a huge understatement. This game is nothing short of astounding. For the last 3 years Sony has been bragging that their cell processor was more powerful than the Xbox 360's, but it was just \"potential\" power. We never actually saw a game that really fleshed out this claim. Uncharted 2 is that game. The bar has officially been raised. I've had some real seminal moments in gaming. Resident Evil 4, Gears Of War1 & 2, Modern Warfare, and Bioshock (and Uncharted 1) are among some of my favorite games that pushed the envelope in many ways. Uncharted 2 has surpassed them all and then some.<br />The graphics are the best I've ever seen, the gameplay will leave you breathless and the story just soars. The thing that impressed me the most however is that while there are a million things going on onscreen, there was never a hiccup in the frame rate or any slow down whatsoever! It just goes to show you that several cross platform games from a few years back that ran smoother on the 360, were do to developers not knowing how to harness the power of the PS3, period. I have not played multiplayer yet so I cannot comment on it. I beat the game last night and will be starting a new campaign immediately.

That’s all well and fine, except the reason you run out of lives is inexcusable. Your characters move so fast, that it feels unnatural, especially when half the time they don’t go in the direction you want them to.

You’ll either hop to the next like you’re supposed to, or just jump completely passed it.<br /><br />And that’s pretty much what kept killing me over and over.

I played for 65 hours, beat the game and the dlc and only completed 21% of the game. That’s how massive it is. Heck, I never even went to half of the areas in the game that you can go to.<br /><br />Gone are the items and temples from every other Zelda game. Here you get a smartphone thing that gives you a handful of skills to help solve puzzles. There are no more temples, replaced by 120 shrines, which are basically mini temples. They’re clever and fun for the most part, and many require puzzle solving to even open them.<br /><br />Instead of a couple swords and shields, you can pick up anything an enemy uses, but they’ll all break eventually.<br /><br />I personally prefer the old style Zelda to all this, but it’s pretty good. My biggest complaint comes from climbing, which is what you will spend half the game doing. You get limited stamina, so you have to plan your climbs. This would be fine in small doses, but as I said, you climb a lot, and it’s slow and tedious. What makes it worse is when it rains, the ledges become slippery and you’ll slide down constantly, making it almost impossible to climb some ledges.

They changed up all the items, to make them original, the races are longer and the character roster is much bigger. The transformations are WAY better than MarioKart 7s propellors and gliders.<br /><br /> But don't buy this without expecting a challenge. This game is extremely difficult. (If you play it on hard anyway, but that's required if you want to unlock most things) A lot of this is due to the fact that you can't see whats coming a lot of the time and you have to depend solely on instinct and reaction, which often isn't enough because you'll come up to like a 100 degree turn with no warning and never make it around it without crashing into a wall.<br /><br />That is the biggest downfall. Too often I find myself not knowing which way the road turns or I drive into a wall because I think its a way to go, because the real way to go is hardly noticeable or I end up taking a turn that sends me on a different path, but going the wrong way. (There are many different routes in the races to take, which is a good thing...) but not when you accidently take one back when you are confused.<br /><br />Overall, this game is fun and worth checking out. But it does not come close to MarioKart.

You have to keep an eye on your paint level, as well as the cards you have to play, which makes it somewhat unique.  You also cannot take too long strategizing, or looking too long in your hand for a card to play, or else your cards may get stolen.  I have had this happen twice.

I have enjoyed each one immensely and they are all completely addicting.  I like the new added touches of the newer games, and the simplistic fun factor of the originals.  The ones based on movies do an excellent job of pulling in memorable scenes and making them with a bit more childish humor.  I just received this game today, so I don't have much playtime to make a completely accurate rating on this so far.  However, from what I have played, this one seems to be the most widespread.  You don't seem too confined to one spot, which can make for a bit of a hardship if you don't know your way around Middle-earth.

The most enjoyable aspect of the game is the voice over from the movie.  In previous Lego games, excluding Lego Batman, there were no true voices, just random mumblings and sounds.  This one has the actual dialogue from the movie, and the music has the same eerie overtone as the movie as well.  The cut scenes are a blast and the gameplay is fun, thus far.

The landscape is changed as you travel through the entire Gotham City searching for things to unlock and discover.  There aren't as many levels, but each level seems a bit longer.  The addition I really like, besides the new character additions (more on that later), is the addition that allows you to save at different stages in each level.  The new suits for both Batman and Robin are unique and fun to access as well.  I agree with another review that the most fun is using Superman to fly around Gotham City searching for gold bricks and unlockable characters.  I am nearly half way through the game, without having finished the story, and have found it equal to the fun level of the other Lego games.  I enjoy being able to use Hawkman, Aquaman, Superman, and look forward to unlocking Green Lantern, Flash, and Wonder Woman to add to the Heroes I can use.  The new Villains are great fun as well.  When I saw Braniac, I absolutely knew I wanted to use him in Free Play mode.  There are some instances during the game where I get turned around and lost due to the view of the game, and other times where I get stuck, but those are so infrequent and don't take away from the overall fun of the game.  I think this is a lot more fun than the original Lego Batman, because of the character additions and expanded Gotham City.  Instead of buying the characters from a Hub type location in some of the previous Lego games, this requires you to beat (a ridiculously easy) Villain after locating them in Gotham somewhere.

This has the original Trivial Pursuit game format and a new Bet You Know it version.  First, I will review the original version.  I have not played this one with another person, but I have played alone with a very fun version of it.  In this version, you get to answer multiple questions from each of the six categories to build up your points.  You earn bonus points for each correct answer toward that category.  After you earn enough points, you go toward one of the category spots and answer a question.  If you get it right, you multiply your score times the amount of answers you answered correctly for that category.  For example, if you answered three questions about History correctly during your travels around the board, then your score gets multiplied by three.  If you get it wrong then the bonus points goes down by one.  After you do this for all six categories, you answer one last question to get a final score using all the bonuses.  If you get it wrong, again you lose some of the bonus points.  You try to get the highest score possible and compete for the overall high score record on your personal system.  This is an addicting game, and I like playing it to see if I can get higher scores each time.  Each game is different, and adds to the fun factor of it.  You can even choose to have only movie questions, or just regular game questions.  This is the only version of the original game I have played.<br /><br />The Bet You Know It version is also fun.  You can play single or multiplayer on this as well.  In multiplayer mode, you can use poker chips to bet on whether or not the other person will get the answer correct or incorrect.  If you are right, then you gets the chips.  If you guess that the person would get it wrong, and thet get it right, then they get the chips.  Chips can be used to up the value of a particular category if a person needs to buy that one, to buy category pieces, and to change the subjects offered to your opponent.  This brings in some strategy to an already fun trivia game, and I love this addition.  This offers a way you can pick your category out of four offered, which gives everyone a chance to win.  You can also buy pieces, which can give more people a chance of winning too.  This is a game for trivia geeks and others who may not be as exuberant in their trivia knowledge.  The variation on topics is enormous.  I had Ancient History, Comic Books, Cheese, and Video Games to choose from for the Literature piece.

This addition is the best, graphically, as well as the most intuitive, in terms of gameplay.  The MotionPlus really works well, but takes some getting used to at first.  Even in some battles, I find myself not getting the proper movements, but it helps add to the challenge factor of the game.  It doesn't get frustrating, just makes you think about how you are swinging.  I have only been as far as the first temple, but it is so engrossing.  I am positive each temple will be as equal to it, or more engrossing as the first.  Getting new weapons is just as exciting and rewarding as any of the other Zelda games from the past.  Not only is the sword different, but the shield is unpresidented as well.  The first shield you get is weak and can only take so many blows, as well as needs to avoid fire, or it will burn.  I liked this addition, as it makes you use your shield more wisely.<br /><br />The cut screens are numerous, but not entirely wasteful.  I gathered a lot of information from them, and enjoyed the interaction between characters.  The hints provided by these cut screens and the Goddess have been very helpful in times of need, when I was at a loss of what to do.<br /><br />I think my favorite aspect of this game is when you save the game.

I love the LEGO games, because my six year old daughter will play them with me.  Though this one proves the most challenging to her, she still plays it.  I have been stuck at times in this game, because there aren't a lot of instruction at times, but the puzzlement is what makes these games so addicting.  I like the Jack Sparrow compass aspect of the game, it gives the game a little bit more challenge in some areas.  Like LEGO Star Wars III, you cannot purchase new characters from one specific place, as you did in all previous others, you have to find them wandering around the areas outside the level play.<br /><br />I do wish the levels had more playing levels each, it seems a bit short for each of the movies.  I do, however, like that LEGO included the last of the movies.  I am torn on whether or not to play it until watching the movie, so as not to spoil any surprises.  It will be tough to resist playing it until then, though.<br /><br />I have only played the first two movies and felt that each did justice to the movies.  The cut scenes were very well done, and the levels well thought out, but, as I stated before, I would have liked to have seen more levels than just the five.  There seemed to bee many more levels they could have chosen.<br /><br />The LEGO characters were great resemblance to the actual characters, and each had their own hidden talents, like all previous LEGO games.  The women characters can jump higher, like LEGO Batman, and there are characters with more deadly weapon, such as the bazookas in Indiana Jones.  The new Ghost Pirate characters, which can walk underwater, are great, and are needed to unlock more from each level.<br /><br />Overall, this game is just what was expected and more.  I have three grievances, which are small and somewhat insignificant in the grander scheme of things.  I wish the levels were longer and some levels are too dark for my television.  The last grievance seems to be happening to others as well.  My Wii freezes from time to time, and mostly it is from going back and forth through each cut screen.  If I go too swiftly, it freezes.  I noticed this happening on LEGO Star Wars III as well, but not the others.

It is just as addicting as the others, and my 6 year old daughter can also play with relative ease.

I really enjoy how the Classic Star Wars characters, like Princess Leia and Qui-Gon Jinn are unlockable only after finding the Mini-Kits in each level.  I liked the added lightsaber attributes, like cutting holes in metal doors, and throwing it at characters.  You also have to get enough Gold Bricks in order to move through the \"Hub\" type area.  This is on board the large spaceship, and you can move to another one with the villain characters as well.  The characters to unlock are not simply in one location where you can purchase, which adds to the challenge of collecting all characters.  At first, I was a little put off by this, because I was so used to the other format, but I think I like this way better.  The challenge is what makes this game so fun.

I was a little disappointed to see there was not a draft, but I ended up trading for the players I actually knew.  The gameplay is fun, and my five year old actually played the shoot out with me.  She liked the use of the stick as well.  The gameplay is more challenging than the hockey games I used to play on other systems, which I find enjoyable. It's not downright frustrating playing like some games are, and it isn't too easy where I can win every game.  This has just the right amount of challenge and ease of play to make it enjoyable and puzzling at the same time.  I find that I get bored with games I can win everytime, and I enjoy the challenge to have to get better to win a game.  This is definitely the type of game if you have the same mindset.

You don't have to be sitting in the same room any longer.  You don't even have to know the people you are shooting at.  Even though I still suck at this game, it is so much fun and a great challenge to try to go after people who spend every waking hour playing video games.  It is a nice to just kick back and immerse yourself into the online multiplayer.  It's definitely addicting.  I would have bought this game if this was the only thing available to do on it.

I still have the college version of the game for the SNES and played it with my 5-year old.  I read other reviews where people are complaining about the graphics compared to the PS3 or X-Box, the fact you cannot play online, or other grievances the game does not have.  These people, it seems to me, are spoiled, arrogant people who have always been given whatever they wanted.  These people can never be satisfied with what it given to them, but must find something to complain about no matter what it is.  Sure, the game would be fun to play with someone online, but it's not a reason to give a bad review because it's not there.  I think you should review games based on what's there, instead of what is not.<br /><br />This Wii version is everything I remember and a whole lot more.  The graphics are amazing for the Wii and brings to life each player.  The gameplay is what makes this game so enjoyable, because there are so many formats to play.<br /><br />The quick game gets you to pick a team to play with and you only get to play one game at a time.  This is good if you want to get used to the game or want to see which teams suits you best.<br /><br />The Classic Campaign is just as it says it is, it is just like the original game.  You choose one team and play as that team against all the other teams.  You also go up against hidden teams, and if you beat them you unlock them in the other modes.  These are teams like Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, Dominuque Wilkins and Spud Webb, Hakeem Olajuwon, Patrick Ewing and John Starks, and much more.<br /><br />Remix Tour is a different kind of game.  You still choose a team but this time you play the other games offered on the game.  These games are 21, Dominance, BackBoard Smash, Elimination, Remix 2v2, and Boss Battle.  21 is just like in the backyard.  You have to be the first person to score 21 points or more.  If you score, you keep the ball.  This is a blast to play against the computer or another player.  Dominance is a game where you have to take over spots on the floor.  The more spots you take control of, the more points you earn.  The longer you keep the spot, the more points you earn.  Smash is a game where you have to dunk enough times to smash the backboard.  Elimination is a game in which the person with the lowest score is eliminated after each round.  You can play with 3 or 4 players.  The last one standing at the end wins.  Remix is the fun 2v2 game where you have power ups on the court you can pick up and use during the game.  The power ups are okay, but could be better.  The quick one is the best power up.  and the Boss Battle is a fun challenge.  You have to beat a player one on one.  You have to go up against the likes or Yao, CP3, Larry Bird, Magic, LeBron, Kobe, and even Dr. J.  They each have their own strengths and the battles themselves are quite different each time.  Larry Bird has a shot where he makes three 3's in a row to give him 9 points, which is hard when you are only playing to 21.<br /><br />These games also have within themselves unlockables to unlock different players.  These are things such as getting 10 rebounds, steals, dunks, jump shots, 3-pointers, and others.  This keeps the game enjoyable well past the initial one player game to beat the computer.<br /><br />As stated in the title, this is a little piece of nostalgia that makes playing video games so much fun.

It has great graphics and sound. But the gameplay is frustrating.<br /><br />This game takes place in Africa. The environment is fantastic. From dawn till dusk is amazing to watch. Even the flames are very good when things blow up. The ground can be set on fire. You see a few animals here and there.<br /><br />You get plenty of weapons. However you can only carry about three to four weapons. They can be upgraded but the guns will degrade over time.<br /><br />There are several downsides to the game. Nearly all the characters all want to kill you. You can drive from one area to the next and you're constantly in a shootout. Jeeps, trucks, and cars will ram you which and then try to kill you. There's bus stops which can transport you to any location but you have to reach them so carry lots of ammo. You come across several outposts with bad guys all around them. After you take them out and leave, when you drive back, they re-spawn. This is very annoying. You do work with several factions but they rarely help you. It would be nice to see the factions you work with take over the outposts so you don't get shot when you drive by. Almost all the time the missions are either get this item or kill this bad guy. Also you're character is infected with Malaria disease and there's no cure. You can get prescription medication but it gets frustrating when you're in a shoot out and your character starts to collapse unless you take the drugs or you're dead. Occasionally your teammates will work with you if you want but you have to gain their trust through side missions. The ending is much to be desired and you'll be very disappointed after all the trouble you went through. I don't understand why writers have to create awful endings.<br /><br />Even if the game is cheap to buy, don't buy it.

I used to own Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, San Andreas, and GTA 4. While GTA 4 was a big step in the right direction in terms of gameplay and graphics, it was almost entirely in the city and it was missing out the open large world of San Andreas. GTA 5 brought it all together.<br /><br />The whole map is huge. The landscape is fantastic. Cities, mountains, hills, valleys, rivers, sea's, lakes, countryside, and the ocean. So many places to explore. The graphics is amazing to stand and look around. Go on top of a building and look below. Take a swim in the ocean and dive underwater. You can explore ship & plane wrecks. Fly around the map. The city is very lively. You walk by and hear all kinds of conversations and they're pretty funny to listen too. There's animals in this game and some will attack you! Some people will ask for help while others will try to steal your vehicle or try to take you down.<br /><br />The music is excellent. Real authentic music and not garbage that you've never off.<br /><br />The gameplay is what shines. The controls are easy to figure out as you progress in the game. Previous games were deemed to difficult by casual or the average gamer's so the developers decided to fix the problem. There's cheat codes if you want, but I didn't need to use any. Only after I beat the game the first time, I decided to use the codes to have more fun. Every level there's a challenge if you want to score 100% such as no damage, shoot accuracy, etc. But even if you beat the level at 50% or more, you can move to the next part of the game. The great thing is you can go back, repeat any level and see if you can get the 100% score.<br /><br />The three characters each have funny storylines. Trevor is the best character and his dialogue is great. All the characters you play have special abilities. You can also enhance the characters like running, stealth, climbing, shooting, swimming, holding you breath as you go underwater, etc. Yes there's stealth elements if you don't want to go guns blazing.<br /><br />You can drive cars, trucks, trains, planes, bicycles, motorbikes, boats, jet ski's and a submarine. The controls are very easy to figure out.<br /><br />From the beginning, the whole area is available to explore unlike the previous games. By playing the game, you make money where you can buy properties like airports, car garages, and sea ports. Other properties can help you make money but certain properties can only be bought by specific characters.<br /><br />All the guns in the game can be upgraded. Such as to be able to carry extra ammo, silencers, scope, etc. In the beginning, you're characters already have many weapons on them.<br /><br />There's three different endings. The third ending is the hardest but after you beat the game, you can continue to play as all three character while the other two endings, you'll only play as two characters while the third is killed off.<br /><br />Rockstar gave may updates and DLC's to the gamers. I received many updates for both the online and the single player content.<br /><br />I don't play online but they give you the option if you want to. You get to play with other players and friends.<br /><br />This is the best GTA game I've ever played. If you're a novice, casual or average gamer, you'll love this game.

If she gets injured, you have to heal her. If you're partner dies, its game over. Its your decision to give her the ammo and supplies or to keep it. If you run out, she will give you ammo and if your hurt, she'll heal you. There is no pause on selecting items, ammo and weapons unlike the previous games. So you have to be quick or before entering the next area, resupply yourself and your partner.<br /><br />Even on Easy mode, it gets hard. You have to be good at targeting enemies who walk and dodge at you. Many can now aim and shoot. If you or your partner dies, you have to watch the same cut scene over and over again. It gets annoying. There's no way to skip it.<br /><br />I played about half way before quitting. If you want to unlock weapons or the infinite ammo, you have to beat it once. I couldn't get to far.

The game developers took their time and energy to make every area believable. The atmosphere can really draw you into the game. You feel for the characters when disaster strikes. The game has fantastic voice acting. So if you're a fan of Zombie movies or shows, you'll really get into this game.<br /><br />The game is difficult regardless of which level you start. I started on Easy and I found it very difficult. Easy is like Normal to me. I died many times getting through one area. I read and watched game walk through's and maps. Most of the time you sneak around corners either trying to knock out the enemy from behind or fight your way out. The weapons you have are limited. Don't expect to find ammunition scattered around. Also the weapons can be upgraded but its up to you to decide which weapon is best for the upcoming area's. This game isn't a shooter.<br /><br />The worst part is when you die, you start from the checkpoint again. Its good but if you die, you'll lose you're upgrades if you upgraded your items or weapons halfway past the checkpoint. Your guns & skills get better over time if you scavenge through ever area thoroughly. There no regenerative health. Once you run out of health, you start over from the checkpoint with the monsters again.<br /><br />There's a DLC which deals with the young girl in the game. Its a prequel. Almost every DLC is made specifically for multiplayer such as upgrades to your character but it can't be played in the single player mode.<br /><br />This game is highly rated online by both gamer's and gaming websites.

I'm a huge fan of transformers. I love the shows, toys and comics. No I don't like any of the live action movies. There's only a few games that dealt with the original story. Its a good game but not great.<br /><br />The story is a little confusing. Wish they showed more about how Megatron and Optimus Prime became enemies other than something to do with Prime bringing Megatron down for something and Megatron wanting revenge. Megatron finds out that Starscream has dark energon and Megatron wants to control and use it on Cybertron. Hasbro claims this is part of the original G1 Story. Many G1 fans dispute this claim and feel its more of a reboot than being part of the show.<br /><br />The game is squad based. You don't order anyone and they're with you throughout the game. Each character has their own guns and special abilities. However the Autobot Sideswipe is my favorite as he using a spinning tornado move that can damage or destroy his enemies easily. War for Cybertron has three difficulty settings. Even on easy, it can be difficult and frustrating. I found the level where Ratchet has to repair Omega Supreme and you have to defend him to be extremely frustrating. I constantly died over and over again. Thankfully the checkpoints are there so you don't have to start from the beginning of the level. There not much to unlock and only two characters to unlock but not for the single player campaign. Also some characters have weak weapons and abilities. Big characters are tough and slow.<br /><br />You can play co-op with friends in campaign. Which can be very fun.<br /><br />The controls are great and easy to use. The voice overs are excellent. There's plenty of humor throughout the game. The sound and music is fantastic.

Now I've read and watched reviews regarding the pro's and con's before buying it. Rogue should have been cheaper. Like forty dollars brand new and not sixty. I traded in two games and got it on sale. So in the end, I paid only two dollars!<br /><br />Rogue is the sequel to Black Flag but a prequel to Assassins Creed 3. This is the first game in which you get to play as a Templar named Shay Cormac. The Assassins in this game act more evil, selfish, and willing to sacrifice anyone than in all the previous games. The Templar's care about the people. Haytham Kenway who is the main villain in Assassins Creed 3, helps Shay Cormac progress throughout the game by explaining the misinformation about the Templar's. Shay behaves more like Conner. He's impatient and wants to stop his former friends but he doesn't want to kill them even though they give him no choice.<br /><br />Rogue is almost identical to Black Flag in game play with few upgrades. Now you have three area's to explore. New York, A River Valley and the North Atlantic. The North Atlantic is unique as you can now use icebergs to damage or destroy ships. You ship however only as one new upgrade which is an icebreaker that can go through ice and damage ships. Unlike Black Flag, I nearly fully upgraded my ship before Shay joined the Templar's. After joining, my ship was maxed out. There is no new upgrades to melee fighting. You do get a new weapon to the rifle: The fire cracker. It can blow up barrels or get enemies out in the open. You do get a all new weapon: The grenade launcher. It can fire explosive, berserk and sleeping gas bombs. You hunt animals both land and sea to upgrade your characters armor, health and weapons. There's nothing new there. There are many area's to explore but many places there's barely any life. It feels abandoned and desolate. Now as a Templar, you're hunted by other Assassins but its easy to find them using Eagle Vision. If you don't counter them, they can kill you instantly with one hit or if you upgraded your character fully, the Assassins can take 85% of your health. There is no mulitplayer unlike Black Flag. Also many of the pistols and guns are worthless unless you complete the side missions. Watching the end credits takes more than twenty five minutes! It would be great to push a button to bypass it.<br /><br />I did have some problems fighting enemy boss battles on land. I ended up using my pistols to take them down. The Legendary Ship Battles weren't much of a problem except for the Storm Fortress. You fighting against three ships. Your fleet is very weak when fighting with you against the Legendary Ships. I ended up using god mode and infinite ammo to take out the Storm Fortress but lost the ability to get the extra items from beating these ships. Rogue also never fixed the problems Black Flag with the running up walls, rocks, and tree's when you don't want to. It can be frustrating when chasing someone but then your character runs in the wrong direction or jumps down on the wrong person. Some animals are really hard to find even with the map. They randomly show up if your lucky, there may be more than one.<br /><br />The Environment is outstanding. The weather is great. You move about in the snow and blizzard. Occasionally you'll run into a rogue wave. Rarely does it rain. There is no underwater levels to explore.<br /><br />The modern world can get annoying. You play in first person just like Black Flag. But instead of hacking into computers, you're repairing them. Repairing them can be a little complicated and tough at times. I ended going online and watching video's on how to solve them. But what really irritates me is they pester you to fix a computer and go back to your desk. You just can't walk around and explore your environment. Wish the supervisor would just Shut Up!<br /><br />The sound is still excellent. You hear the ocean, river, animals, tree's and people having conversations.<br /><br />You can download extra DLC's to further enjoy the game. Unlock item locations, maps, items, extra weapons, etc. I haven't done so but one day I will.<br /><br />Overall its a great game. There are a few problems and can frustrating at times. Regardless I was able to enjoy the game. It has a great story to watch, plenty of side missions, & area's to explore. I recommend this game and Black Flag.", "ParentASIN": "B00MAM0ALA", "Timestamp": 1422840871000, "ItemName": "Assassin's Creed Rogue- Xbox 360", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.5, "RatingCount": 1280, "Price": 23.95, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "Xbox Systems", "Xbox 360"], "Description": "In Assassin's Creed Rogue, players experience the story from the perspective of Shay, a former Assassin turned Templar.

One, The Second Trilogy, and Three. Although I never finished three due to one level I couldn't pass no matter how much I tried. I bought this game before three and its still the best one I've played.<br /><br />Black Flag is more open ended that all the previous games. You're given many ways to take an enemy out. Either by being sneaky or going straight into battle. Rarely there's a mission requiring you to complete a stage without being seen. This game fixes many of the problems that Assassins Creed Three such as hiding and whistling to enemies to take them out, more ways to make money include contracts, chests, treasures, raiding ships for Rum, Sugar, Cloth, Wood and Metal.<br /><br />The story is excellent. You play as Edward Kenway, a guy who wants to live in the open seas, making money for himself and his wife. He doesn't really care for the brotherhood as long as the money is good. Edwards kills people throughout the game without remorse, guilt or compassion. Only towards the end he finds out as his friends are either captured or killed, he has a change of heart about the life he's living and how he should be living. Many characters along the way are memorable both villains, civilians, pirates, and hero's. There's plenty of humor in the game and conversations to listen you.<br /><br />The gameplay is what many games should be. Open Ended. Being able to take alternate routes to finish a level or mission without restraint. You can fight with your fists, sword fight, gun, rope, and darts. You can quietly take out enemies without killing them or poison them with darts that make the enemy go berserk and attack others around them which can be very effective in missions by hiding in fields or bushes. Or by using dart ropes to quietly hang the bad guys. Its easy to make money. You can even find extra ammo on the enemy characters themselves. Your ship known as the Jackdaw, should be upgraded when you get the money, wood and metal. Its very important later on both in the main and side missions. You'll be attacked by other ships and by upgrading your ship, its easier to take down base forts. You can pay characters or take over ships to remove your wanted level. You also get to dive underwater to sunken ships, caves and Atlantis. The only downside is the sharks that constantly get in your way thus you can't enjoy looking around when you want to. Also I never get the 100% completion. I try but fail most of the time. I prefer to just play the game.<br /><br />Most hardcore gamers didn't like the fact that the game was open ended and non linear. Thus newbies, casual and moderate player can get into the game without all the frustration from past Assassin games. The A.I. is not as aggressive and can be an idiot at times. But I'm a casual gamer and found the game enjoyable. Some boss battles can be tough such as fighting the legendary ships, but against regular people, it can be easy to defeat.<br /><br />The sound is awesome. From sailing, oceans, islands, people, atmosphere and animals, its really breathtaking. Every island is lively with people and animals. The weather effects is great. From day to night and from rain to clear its fun to experience the life of being a pirate.<br /><br />You also get to experience the modern world. The game takes place inside a Templar business center where they try and find clues to secret treasures from the games currently or previous. Abstergo Entertainment which is run by Templar's, uses the Animus to find the first civilization but is constantly being hacked by others. You play as an unknown character but is forced to hack into computers to find out what the Templar's have learned and gained from others like Desmond Miles and the Assassins. The modern world is very lively as well inside the building. Hacking is easy in the beginning but later on it gets a little harder. I found some guides online and was able to get through.<br /><br />The controls are easy to master. Each button has a particular action. But mainly you'll be running around by holding down the R1 Button but it can wear your finger out. Sometimes the character will still run up on walls and tree's when you don't want to. Eagle Vision is enhanced. Once you spot your target, it now stands out. You can even see the target through walls, rocks, and tree's! Naval combat is easy as well. You can ram, fire your cannons or fire from long range. Once you disable the ship, either destroy it, plunder it for money and repairs, or add it too your fleet.<br /><br />By buying the game new, you get three downloadable missions where you play as Aveline de Grandpre, the Assassin from Liberation. They're very good levels to play with. The female character is fully upgraded and taking down the enemy is fun. There are more downloadable levels, weapons, islands, and accessories that you can customize the player and the ship. You can play multiplayer if you want. I chose not too.<br /><br />I recommend this game to casual gamers or fans of the series. I enjoyed playing the game. It took me over a month to beat this game. I put in about two or three hours a day. I didn't collect everything but I was satisfied in the end.

While this is a Lego Game, its the best one I've played.<br /><br />The story is fantastic. The Avengers, Shield, Fantastic Four, Spiderman, X-Men and others battle Loki, Doctor Doom, Red Skull, Hydra, Galactus etc. Its a basic story of Good Vs Evil. Unlike Lego Batman 2 where mostly you play as Batman, Robin and Superman but then towards the end you play with the other Justice League characters, this game allows you to play with a variety of characters throughout the lengthy campaign. Many side missions to complete, races, mini games, etc. All the characters have unique attacks and superpowers. Some can use fire, ice, lasers, electricity, and much more. Over 150 characters to unlock and more through DLC. Some are the same but with different costumes. After the Campaign, in the Free Roam mode, there are more missions like helping Blade deal with monsters and the Punisher asking you to take out vehicles and bad guys. Some civilians will ask for assistance like saving their pets, finding family members, opening doors, asking for someone to drive them to a certain location, or mind controlling a person or a group of people. Many vehicles to unlock and play with. The game has plenty of humor and voice overs.<br /><br />The city is huge. It takes a while to fly from one end to another. Many landmarks from the comics like the Stark Tower, Oscorp, Rykers Island, Shield Helicarrier, X-Mansion, Liberty Island, etc. The city is lively. People move about by walking, running, and driving. Unlike Lego Batman 2 when you run over the civilians, they nothing. Here they say comments like that's not funny. The free roam mode takes place in the sunlight unlike the previous game where it took place at night.<br /><br />There's a few bugs and glitches like problems with the camera, characters get stuck for no reason, and once in a while the game will freeze but restarting again will fix the problem.<br /><br />The soundtrack is amazing. Most of the level music is taken from the movies. The music is pleasant to listen to.<br /><br />The controls are easy to figure out. So anyone can play this game. Adults who aren't good at games, you'll enjoy playing this by yourself, friends or with children.<br /><br />Some races I have come across can be a little challenging but not difficult. The game is light on challenge so it doesn't frustrate the player.

I read many reviews that gave this game an 8 out of 10 scores. I bought the game during the holiday for ten dollars.<br /><br />My main gripe with the game is the story. You mainly play as Batman and Robin while Superman occasionally show up here and there. Towards the end, you get to play with the other hero's like Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Flash etc. There are mainly two major villains you deal with: Lex Luthor and Joker. All the other villains have minor roles. Batman eventually teams up with his rival Superman to battle the duo.<br /><br />The game gets repetitive. The free roam mode is great but it always takes place at night. Yes I know the Gotham story takes place at night but I wish it would change from night to day and back. Occasionally it rains which is nice. The controls are great.<br /><br />The sound track is good but I wish Warner Bros would have allowed Traveller's Tales to use more music. For instance, there is the batman and superman themes when you take control of their characters but what about Supergirl, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, and the Flash? They have themes from their shows and movies. You hear the same theme over and over again. Many civilians barely have anything to say.<br /><br />The controls is great. The camera can get a little annoying. Occasionally it gets stuck in some area's but it doesn't stop you from playing the game. There is a few glitches where characters disappear for no reason. One level called Core Instability where you get chased by a giant Joker robot while driving, you can collect mini kits and special items. But if you hit the wrong objects, you will miss the majority of them. Free Roam allows you to use all the characters and vehicles you collect to view the large area's you visited. The game will freeze every now and then which forces you to restart, but after that its OK.<br /><br />The game can be beaten around ten hours. Its a short game. Its more like an rental. I bought the game for ten dollars so I didn't lose much. I did buy Lego Marvel Super Hero's which I enjoyed immensely & I do recommend. Lego Batman 2 is good but not great.

I enjoyed playing Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag so I decided to buy the prequel to see if I would like this game. Many people told me its very buggy and difficult. They were right.<br /><br />The game has an OK story. You play an American Indian named Conner who seeks out revenge on the Templars led by his father after the attack on his village and the death of his mother. The game takes place during the Revolutionary War. There is plenty of side missions to complete. You also get to build a community, make new friends and allies. The characters aren't as enjoyable as in the previous games and the sequel. The Desmond stages aren't that good. His story feels like a rush job. As in the second trilogy, you eventually take control of a brotherhood and send them through out on missions or help you in when your in trouble. Unlike the previous games and the sequel: Black Flag, Chests are few and far between. You make money from trade, contracts, mini games, and sending your brotherhood on side missions. Which does take a while unless you're really good and have the patience to wait.<br /><br />Since I played the sequel, I enjoyed the controls and combat. Here its very frustrating in the many stages I went through. Many times my character would run up trees and walls when I didn't want too. The enemy spots you easily, if you run and take cover, they still somehow manage to find you which can be frustrating. Optional objective is also difficult to get. As in many Assassin Creed games, I never could get the 100% completion. Many levels are linear. Meaning point A to Point B with very few alternate area's to make it easier on the players. Some levels are very difficult to overcome. One level called Sequence 7: Battle of Bunker Hill forces the character to run from cover to cover. While the game has regenerative health, this level doesn't allow you to use it until get by the first stage. Four or five hits and you'll have to start over again until you get by the shooting. That's when I stopped playing. After one hour of trying to get by, I quit and uninstalled the game. I went online watching video's, faqs, guides and still I couldn't get through. I loved Black Flag but hated this game.<br /><br />The graphics is good in that its a step up from the second trilogy but its very buggy. Sometimes people tend to disappear when you walk by or they go through fences and buildings. When it rains, people go about there business as if it was a sunny day. The rain and snow is great to view but why don't people take shelter or cover?! I would've thought the game developers should have recognized this and fixed it. Black Flag has the same problem.<br /><br />The sound is excellent. Plenty of conversations to listen to. The atmosphere is fantastic. The city is lively.<br /><br />But in the end, after I tried to get by the Battle of Bunker Hill level and failed miserably, I gave up. I've beaten every Assassins game I've played but this game I was too much for me. My blood boiled and I decided to get rid of it. It reminds me of Assassins Creed Brotherhood where you had to use the hang glider and attack the enemy from above. After failing for about a week, I finally managed to get by. But I didn't like the game for its punishing difficulty, but that's me.<br /><br />Skip this game and buy Black Flag. The game is open ended with less bugs and the difficulty isn't as punishing as Assassins Creed 3. I watched all the cut scenes on YouTube and the story was a fail.

My favorite game is Jedi Academy. So I was thrilled when Lucas Arts was making a game that was going to be on the Playstation 2. Originally Jedi Academy was going to be on the PC, Mac, Xbox and PS2 but they skipped the PS2 believing the system didn't have the capabilities. So only the Xbox, Mac and PC got the game. So could this be the game I was hoping for?!<br /><br />Yes and No. First the Graphics are very good when playing through the levels. But the cut scenes are plain and devoid of emotions.<br /><br />The gameplay is hit and miss. While the controls are great and easy to pick up, even on easy mode it can be a real challenge. It takes several hits to take down a single enemy. Some take two hits while others take more than five. The boss battles are easy in the beginning but later on can be frustrating. All major boss battles are in a timed button fight. Another words, when you fight the boss, button symbols will appear on screen asking you to quickly press or press repeatedly the buttons until the sequence is done. If you mess up just once, you have to start all over again. Which made me very angry and tiresome. Your thumbs or fingers will be worn out. Your PS2 buttons will eventually be worn out as well if your not careful! In Jedi Academy, all you had to do was swing the lightsaber on your opponent or shoot your guns until the enemy was defeated.<br /><br />There is only a single player campaign. No multiplayer option. The game is very linear meaning you can't take alternate paths to reach your goal. You follow the map and it directs you to the locations.<br /><br />The Story is very good. Very well written. The voice acting is excellent. But the game feels like they could have done more.<br /><br />The sound as always is excellent. The Star Wars music enhances the game.<br /><br />There are plenty of extra's to play around with. But its missing the stage select option! Once you done, it will ask you to start all over again with all your powers. I don't understand why didn't they add a stage select?!<br /><br />But the game was not done directly by Lucasarts. It was done by Krome Studios. Good effort. The PS2 got exclusive levels not scene in the other versions.<br /><br />Force Unleashed was one of the last Playstation 2 games to be made. Its nice to see some companies willing to make PS2 games rather than skipping it.<br /><br />I just wish the game wasn't a button masher when it came to the boss battles. I hate timed sequence action scenes. It takes fun out of the gaming experience.

The things it does, it does well. It has some limitations but if you know these before you buy it and those will not prevent the device from doing what you need it to do, you will love it.<br /><br />From a hardware perspective, it's very small and it looks nice. It could be easily hidden into any entertainment setup and won't look like it's out of place. It has a similar look to Apple TV and Roku set-top boxes and will fit in with any of these devices. The only gripe I have with the design is the fact that your only option for game audio (outside of the TV speakers) and voice input is a bluetooth headset. In my experience, both the Vita and PS TV work very poorly with bluetooth headsets. The one time I have played PS4 games with friends through this device, I joined the party through my Vita and a wired headset to avoid having to use a bluetooth set. It works but it's not an ideal solution. It's also only a workaround for chat audio and does nothing to help you listen to game audio through headphones.<br /><br />I have all other current devices in the Playstation ecosystem (PS4, Vita and PS3) so this is an extra device for me to extend my PS4 to an upstairs TV and give me an option to play some of my Vita games on TV when I'm home. Since I already had accessories like extra Playstation controllers, a memory card that could be shared with my Vita, and Vita games, the core set was fine for me (just the console and cables). If PS TV will be your first and only Playstation console, you might consider getting the bundle set which also includes a Dualshock 3 (PS3) controller, 8 GB memory card and a digital download copy of The Lego Movie game. The controller alone makes the bundle worth the extra money if you don't already have one. You cannot do anything with the PS TV if you don't own a controller.<br /><br />Before you buy, it's important to know what the PS TV does and does not do. Almost all of the negative reviews could have been avoided if the purchaser had done sufficient research. A PS TV allows you to play SOME of the Vita library (physical Vita card format or digitally downloaded), play MOST of the PS1 and PSP classic games available digitally through PSN, run SOME Vita apps, play a limited selection of PS3 games through the PS Now service, and remotely play your PS4 over a local network or over the Internet (Remote Play). Unfortunately, the device will allow you to buy, download and install unsupported games and apps but will not tell you they are not supported until you attempt to run them. You can save yourself money and download time if you check the lists of supported software on the Internet before you buy, install or download anything.<br /><br />The Vita games that are supported run and look great. Some games (Borderlands 2 and Freedom Wars, for example) are even better than they are when played on a Vita because a Dualshock controller has more buttons, which makes some functions easier. As far as entertainment apps are concerned, the PS TV isn't great. Many of the Vita's apps are not compatible (notably, Netflix). This did not matter to me because I have Apple TV and Chromecast already but if you're shopping first for something to stream video content, look elsewhere.<br /><br />The last thing I'll discuss is Remote Play. Depending on your network configuration, your mileage will vary with this feature. Personally, I love Remote Play and because of the way I have my network set up, there is very little difference playing my PS4 downstairs (where the PS4 is connected to the TV) and upstairs (where I can play via Remote Play on PS TV). The reason for this is because I have both my PS4 and my PS TV wired via ethernet cable to my home network. In the Remote Play settings, I am able to set the resolution and frame rate to &#34;High&#34; and still get almost no input lag. Once you start using wifi with either console or if you take your PS TV on the road and try to play over the Internet, you may get lower frame rates, some artifacting in the picture, more noticeable input lag, may have to lower picture settings or you may not even be able to connect at all. There's really no way to know how good Remote Play will be until you get it set up in your home. If you have the ability to wire both consoles to the same network, I can tell you without reservation that your experience will be good.<br /><br />Overall, PS TV is a great little device. It can't do everything the Vita can but in some instances, it's better. In some network setups, it provides a great alternative to moving the PS4 every time you want to play in another room. It's also a great alternative to playing on the small Vita console when you're home and sitting in front of your TV anyway. The experience would be perfect if there were better options for game and chat audio but this has not detracted greatly from my experience. While not all of the Vita library is compatible, the games that are both look and play great. I recommend the PS TV.", "ParentASIN": "B00KUYZ7I6", "Timestamp": 1443632686000, "ItemName": "PlayStation TV DualShock 3 Bundle", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.3, "RatingCount": 383, "Price": 348.99, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation Vita"], "Description": "PlayStation TV offers a wide selection of games, including titles from PlayStation Vita, PS One, and PSP.

For the money", "Content": "The Sony Gold Wireless Headset is excellent. For the money, I don't think you'd find a better gaming headset.<br /><br />For the last two years, I used the original Sony Pulse (not Pulse Elite) set and I liked it but it had a few small issues that are corrected by the Gold set. That set suffered from occasional disconnections. It didn't make the set unusable but it was annoying because it would disconnect at least once or twice for every hour of play. It reconnected itself after a few seconds most of the time but sometimes it took longer and sidetone settings would be reset upon reconnection. The set was also unusable for anything other than game console and PC use since it was exclusively wireless. The Gold set has not had any disconnections over my first few weeks of use and it also includes a wired option, which makes it usable with every device and also is great as a backup option when the batteries are dead. Wired use requires no power from the headset.<br /><br />Other good things about the headset are the eight hour battery life (double that of my Pulse set), great virtual 7.1 surround sound, ability to use custom EQ settings that game developers release for their games, light and comfortable, folding headset for compact storage, and the headset comes with its own carrying bag. I've switched to this headset full time for all my devices (PS4, Mac, Vita and phone) so it's great that it comes with its own bag.<br /><br />I should also mention that the mic is crystal clear. I've been playing with friends for a few weeks and they've all said they can hear clearly. A friend of mine also has the same set and he sounds great to me. You will occasionally hear negative reviews of the mic but these are from people wearing the headset backward, the mic is only good when worn properly. With an integrated mic rather than one with a boom (another great feature over the Pulse set, which had a flimsy boom), it's easy to see how someone could wear them backward.<br /><br />All told, this set is outstanding. I was able to get mine for $69.99 but even at the full $99.99 asking price, they are worth it.

Grenades are something you carefully use as they are not always abundant and they are good for clearing tough situations.<br /><br />One aspect that was interesting was what they called environmental kills and human shields.  Basically, hand to hand and you kill in different ways or you use one as a shield while charging others.<br /><br />Things I didn't care about or was meh.<br />* Germans had a habit of appearing out of nowhere.  You toss a grenade in a room; walk in and one appears.<br />* Game physics and glitches.  Grenades bounced off invisible walls or went through walls.  There are a couple you can walk through but nothing exciting on the other side. Long range kills could happen with short range weapons.  Shotgun?  Really?<br />* Long distance shooting.  Didn't have to have a rifle to kill at long distances.  Could do the same with a couple quick bursts of the machine gun.<br />* Can't keep favorite weapons.  Find a nice sniper rifle with infrared?  Loss it after the completion of the chapter.<br />* Hand guns were not that interesting.  Only purpose is the human shield.<br />* At times close range machine gun fire; you can't kill anything while they could kill you doing the same.<br />* Sometimes bullets chased your target.  Line up a guy and fire.  He moves at that instant and you could see the bullet arc a little and hit him.<br />* Germans can be dumb.  Appearing around the wall, you carefully line up and they don't do anything.  Not always but it did happen.<br />* You get to plant bombs.  It's ok the first couple times but it's meh. There is a danger about doing it but you have to be color blind to have problems.<br />* There really isn't a big baddy to fight at the end of chapters.  Well, there is one but he really isn't a &#34;boss&#34; as he just takes a little more effort to kill.<br />* Explosions really don't kill everybody.

Jorgen Von Strangle was rather low key speaking wise.  Missing is the intensity he usually has.  They also had him doing weight lifting poses and exercising.  It was intended to be funny but the programming had him moving rather fast to the point my girl asked \"what is he doing?\"<br /><br />However, the game was still fun.  Basically the game starts with Timmy wanting to watch Crash Nebula but the TV fails.  He tries to make a wish but Wanda and Cosmos powers aren't working?  So it's off to Fairy World were you learn somebody has made off with all-powerful Royal Jewel and hamstrung the fairies powers.  The one thing to counter it is the all powerful fairyversary muffin.  Timmy has the recipe and sets off to get the ingredients.<br /><br />There are six levels where you must acquire 3 special tools to solve the level.  These tools come from wishes that you get from capturing wish stars that either run away or are found sleeping.<br /><br />Fairly Disastrous:  You are in fairy world where you learn suspect number one is Quince the ex-royal jester.  He has caused all sorts of problems by wrecking things and stealing the colors for cards.  Your first tool is  suit sprayer which you need to activate the cards.  Next is the cowboy suit which you use to lure fairy cows to activate rainbow bridges and get them back to the Dairy Fairy.  Finally, you need to repair things so you have to get the repairatron to handle this.  Finally, you meet Quince.<br /><br />Explore around and make some mental notes as later tools are needed to get rewards you find in the early part of the levels.  Collect all the coins you can as you can buy extra tools to increase your powers and the ability to spot special items and money.  Also, practice your jump pounding skill.  You can take out creatures with this ability.<br /><br />Dads Dream:  Timmy's dad starts to watch TV and gets drawn into the show and passes out.  Timmy has to enter his dad's dreams and wake him up.  You will find a strange world inhabited by suits of clothing, giant frogs, bug zappers and robots.  To fight the suits, you need moths.  To get moths to follow you you need a light bulb.  After you get the first three stars you get Cosmos idea bulb.  He doesn't use it much!  Frogs and bug zappers will require a little thought to get around them.  Later on you can destroy the bulbs for money.  You later find big metal doors and robots.  What to do?  A magnet!  Three stars and you get to wish for one.  The magnet can be used to open the doors and pull bolts from one robot to shoot others.  There are some combo moves with the lightbulb and magnet in this part.  You will notice there are sleeping benches  which you need to wake to get to higher levels.  After three stars you get the Super Irritating Klaxon.  Again there are some combo moves needed with the other tools.  The final battle involves a giant robot.<br /><br />Take it on the Chin:  Off to Chincinati where you find H2Olga has it under water and the Chin is missing.  You you will have some jumping to do so the first tool is Pogo stick of Justice.  Next you find you have to cover distances so you need to flying tool(I forgot the name) which is a biplane that pops out of Clefts cleft.  It only goes for short distances but there are fuel cans for the situations that need more.  They are also placed along the way so it begs the question \"Why are they even there?\"  The final tool is the freeze ray which you need to freeze water creatures to jump on them to get across water levels.  They shoot at you so you can't use the plane.  The final fight involves H2Olga.<br /><br />Get a Clue:  Ace Detective is needed to explore the ex-fairy royalty mansion(King Oberon and Queen Titania for those that remember Shakesphere).  The first tool is the mansion upsidedown turner which flips the mansion upside down so you can get to levels in the roof and get to coins that are on top of things(Can't Cosmo and Wanda fly him there?).  Next you have to scare knights and pass through grills so it's Ghost Boy!  In some cases you have to maneuver knights to certain spots and then use a scare power to keep them there.  If you have other knights, they will freeze but don't worry, they will move again.  The final tool is the special detective goggles which allow you to see a trail of the villains and invisible platforms.  The final fight involves a creature.  It's easy to guess who it is.  Fighting it involves the Goggles and the upsidedown turner.<br /><br />Vicky Strikes Back:  It's off to Yugopotamia where you find Vicky has taken over.  The powers you need to get are a jumping ability, a jet pack and the ability to turn into a pinball ball.  The final fight involves Vicky and Mark Chang.<br /><br />The Great Esc-Ape:  It's the world of the ape overlords again.  You learn that a new ape king has taken over and locks up anybody that dares challenge him since he is fearful of the prophecy of the pink hatted one that will free the apes.  Here you must get the banana shooter, a monkey wrench, and lizard powers.  One of the bugs I mentioned is here.  It occurred when we fell off a slide.  I haven't replicated it so it's probably a positional bug.  The final fight involves the apeking.<br /><br />After that you have the ingredients of the muffin and it's off to fight the shadow showdown!<br /><br />You do get to save positions and you have replay ability to get missing coins, video clips and stickers.<br /><br />We have not played the extras yet and have not viewed the making off.<br /><br />I should mention again, this is a young kids game.  Older kids will get bored by the ease of the game especially when fighting the level bosses.  I have read the game was not received well and I can understand it.  The story line is not good and the graphics are rather amateurish.<br /><br />My girl likes it and wants to replay the levels.  Even my wife likes it but she is not a game player.<br /><br />So for the current cost($[...] new) is not bad if you want something for a 5-7 year old.

Well she is 5 so I do most of the playing.<br /><br />Basically, you get to rotate between Spongebob, Patrick and Plankton through a rather strange adventure.<br /><br />Diesel Dreaming: You start off as Spongebob in the middle of a dream of being a racer.  His bed turns into a car and he gets a crazed crazed game face and then you race.  The racing is ok, I ran it full out the whole time.  You come close to finish but you stop your car just before the finish line and somebody comes by and destroys your car.  Enter the next phase, Spongebob must get his license which runs away from him.  Another race, with Patrick.  Patrick  has a habit of leaving explosives which slow you down.  Again the same near finish with plankton running you over.  Then you must go collect parts to fix your car.  After that a race with Plankton which has a near finish with Gary running you over.  There is another quest to obtain turbo parts for the final race with Gary.  This time you finish but you end up going over a cliff.<br /><br />Overall the racing is easy as mentioned I ran it full out and didn't really need the turbo boost.  There are turbo boost strips and things to dodge all through the races.  Practice as you will need it later.  One thing that is odd is the fact you really aren't racing your opponents as you really never catch them(well I didn't).<br /><br />Starfish man  The Girth of a Hero!  This time you play Patrick as he is Starfishman.  You get calls from a stranger as he guides you through the battle with dreaded Patrick.  The scenes are comic book form and overall it's kind of fun.  Patrick changes outfits every time he fights.  My girl likes it when he is idle and Patrick will grab his belly and wiggle it.  Practice jumping as it will help if you get accurate with it later on.<br /><br />Who Ordered the Super-Size Patty?<br /><br />Now you play Plankton; who as usual has a scheme to enlarge a krabby Patty piece to get the formula.  Unfortunately, he makes it too big and it threatens to attack him.  He enlarges himself but only enough to be as tall as everybody else.  The patty attacks and you spend your time running from it with the help of a freeze ray.  There are short games where you hide in a trash can and collect stuff as it falls.  You have to be careful as the patty sleeps, wakes up and turns around.  You can jump for pieces to get them early or stuff that flies by horizontal.<br /><br />Alaskan Belly Trouble<br /><br />Or as my girl says, the elastic bull worm.  We return to Spongbob as he awakes to find himself falling.  You do some free falling and dodge things and collect coins.  Eventually, you get eating by the worm.  You crash and find Old Man Jenkins who asks you to find stuff to fix a plane.  In return he will fly you out.  The quests are to find the Ironing board wife for the chief.  Three powercell jelly fish for the ineventor and sorting junk for the remaining parts.  Finally, you have to free a blocked chili can which is causing the stomach problems for the worm.  There is jumping fighting and slaping back spit shots from some worm/plant like creatures.  Overall it's a fun episode which is my daughters favorite.<br /><br />Rocket Rodeo<br /><br />Starfishman returns as he is flying through space on the rocket.  He has to doge debris and flys into a black hole.  He ends up in a space station where he has to save the crew from asteroids.  He leaves the station and then goes about fighting a UFO crabby patty which is destroyed by shooting weak spots.<br /><br />Revenge of the Giant Plankton Monster<br /><br />Plankton is back and thinks he was dreaming only to find the patty sleeping next to him.  This time he turns himself into a giant and chases the patty.  It's a fun a game of the monster destroying the town genra.<br /><br />Rooftop rumble:<br /><br />Spongebob and old man Jenkins return as they fly their plane.  Running from plankton (to lure him away from town), dodging things thrown by him and shooting supports to make things drop on him.  Starfishman returns and sets about trying to shrink him back down.  Note:  when plankton starts throwing cars at patrick, there is a ledge you can hide under and not be touched.<br /><br />Hypnotic Highway<br /><br />The final part of the game.  This for some reason was hard for me.  It is a race between Spongebob, Plankton and Patrick.  I was able to finish it by taking different routes.  Speed, dodging obstacles and making time bonus points are essential.  I also didn't bother trying to collect coins.<br /><br />Once you complete the race, you will get the end sequence.<br /><br />Overall I liked the game and have played it many times.  Somethings to consider.  There are coins all through the game, pick them up as they have a unique approach to buying the extras.  You have Spongebob pull a lever to get art, music, cheat codes and extra games.<br /><br />There are also plankton and patrick seeds to open up other things but I haven't been able to get them all yet.", "ParentASIN": "B000FLWC8M", "Timestamp": 1175408057000, "ItemName": "Spongebob Squarepants Creature from the Krusty Krab - PlayStation 2", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.3, "RatingCount": 114, "Price": 21.0, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation 2", "Games"], "Description": "Experience flying and racing with the Wii controller for an intuitive virtual driving experience, and rampage through Bikini Bottom as a giant Plankton by using the controller's accelerometers to punch, stomp, and roar."}, {"Rating": 5.0, "Title": "My first game", "Content": "I received a PS2 this Christmas and CoD3 was the first game I played.

One that took a bit was defending a town(I forget which part of the game) but it involved finding areas to blow with gas mains.<br /><br />Some weapons were short for ammo, especially if you shoot a great deal.  The German weapons taken from the dead didn't seem to remain for a long time so you have only so much time.<br /><br />The hand to hand scenes seemed way to easy and the rifle but attack seemed hard (probably due to my lack of experience with the game controller).<br /><br />There are extras on the game.

They hid behind stuff more and didn't always charge into your line of fire.<br /><br />The chainsaw is gone.  Some of the weapons didn't feel the same.

I finally fired it up on an XP machine.  Do get the upgrade if you can find it.<br /><br />There are 48 scenerios in the self play.  The AI is ok.

For example, when the cannons first appear, you get one scenerio defending a pass.  I didn't ahve to do anything as the cannon fire wiped out that attackers that kept charging into the guns.<br /><br />The hardest scenero for me was vengence.  You are warned to set up before detecting and it is true.  I got noticed and was swarmed.  I built of up defenses in order to build the army.  Unfortunatly, the AI dug in rather well and it took a constant barrage of air armadas of dragons and fairies to defeat the well placed towers.  Each tower was coverd by the others.<br /><br />The GUI can get annoying as if you don't pay attention and click you will send units or builders in a direction you didn't intend.<br /><br />The gold dragon was a fun introduction.  Though I will admit it made the fighting easier.<br /><br />The story line is good.  However, you will switch between sides during the play.  It gets a little strange at times as you invade and set up a base.  Then the next scenerio you play the otherside and are supposed to destroy the base.<br /><br />Overall it's not a bad game.

You get to find them as you have to play each in the game<br /><br />The underground made for some planning as the enemy could double back and attack lightly defended rear cities.<br /><br />The main character(you) isn't all powerfull on the battlefield.  I found it was best to put Merlin(could there have been a better name?) in a town with a level3 tower and farcasting ability and let him rain death from afar.  At times it carried the battlefield.<br /><br />Probably the hardest level was Death 1.  You could not build up forces on a defense war.  Starting out attacking didn't help either.  I found it was best to pull a \"Shermans March\" and build up a few bone dragons, leave some forces and to delay the enemy and march and look for Meander.

I had basic cards and they would not work.  Needed to upgrade anyway as the graphic levels are way more intense these days.<br />I like the idea of Alex Denton but I think the roleplay aspects could have been a little better.  In the first one I was concerned about Paul, took a liking to Tracer Tong but in this one I really didn't care about anybody.  The closest interesting exchange was probably NG Resance but that only went so far.  Also, I didn't get the feeling of are they are friend or foe as much as I did in the first game.<br /><br />The story line is ok. The intro was interesting.  However, as desperate as one group was to destroy Chicago, they really didn't try it again.  A nice \"hateful\" scenario would have been a race against the clock to get at a bomb.<br /><br />You have factions again especially a new one called the Omar.  In one possible ending they could take over the earth.  However, if they are planning that, they probably would have been more involved then simply selling blackmarket stuff in the allyways and backrooms.<br /><br />Another aspect was that maps in this game seemed smaller then I remember from the first one.  You could cover an area in no time.<br /><br />The weapons are ok.  However, the special weapons are interesting.  However, the placement of some seemed to be along the lines of \"hey isn't this cool?  Let's insert it somewhere\"  Some weapons you can really do without(the stun prod and the club).  The weapons mods are plentiful so if you used a glass buster on a pistol.  You can still mod a better one down the road.<br /><br />The biomods are ok.  The best part are the black market biomods.  There are enough of them so if you try something, you can trade it out if you don't like it.  However, I might point out there were not any really noticeable tradeoffs.  The jumping biomod is pretty well useless as the wall climbing ability wipes it out.  You have more things to throw if you want to try the strength mods but I didn't.  You get the hacking mod but I found it was too easy to hack stuff.  The mode to control guns was ok but not really needed.<br /><br />One aspect that made attacking a little to easy was the drone mods.  You can create a drone that shoots tranks.  If you have enough charge ups, you can use a black market biomod that delivers modified EMP blasts that take down humans as well as robots.  This made robot fighting more of a delay then a hassle.<br />Finally, watch your multitools as you need 6 of them at the end of the game and I didn't find many at that point.......<br />There is an easter-egg ending.

I got quesy a few times.  Someone told me they saw an interview with the Rock and he said he thought he had food poisoning after he played it for awhile.  Take breaks!<br /><br />The story line is great and the graphics are great!  One thing I thought was interesting was the fact the chainsaw was \"beefed\" up and became a rather usefull weapon at times.  I didn't use it much on the older games.<br /><br />Another good aspect was that it did get creepy at times.  One thing that \"bugged\" me was a voice that kept asking you to follow her.

{"UserID": "AGJ75ALRVOKWHDTB3GZ4J6QQM2UA", "ReviewList": [{"Rating": 5.0, "Title": "Achieving a Vision vs. Achieving Acceptance", "Content": "Video games have a variety of genres that cater to different people with different desires. Some people want a huge open-world game that they can sink hundreds of hours into just exploring every small detail. Some people want short games that they can just pay a couple bucks for on Steam for a one and done night. Some people want games to play with friends for an enjoyable hangout session. And then there are people like me, people who want a strong, character-driven story to really capture my attention and want to play the game. Obviously, a video game needs to have gameplay – duh – but a game that can have fun gameplay and a well-written, well-acted, and engaging story makes it so much more special for me. The absolute king of this realm is Naughty Dog, most famous for their Crash Bandicoot, Jak and Daxter, and Uncharted series. Uncharted, in particular, is one of the best examples of these cinematic games, providing tight, third-person, cover-based shooting gameplay with exhilarating set pieces and fun characters. Games like these are criticized – “Why not just make them movies or TV shows?” Critiques like these are annoying to me because you being the one who controls these characters, you being the one who hits the buttons that causes these amazing things to happen, makes the experience all that more powerful. Naughty Dog’s latest game, The Last of Us Part II, a sequel to their 2013 game (made after their third Uncharted game), takes this to a whole new level.<br /><br />The original game from earlier this decade is one of the most emotional and powerful games I have ever played. It is the perfect example of games as art. It has tense, stealth-action gameplay where you must collect supplies to survive, making it fun to play, but it really shines with its entire artistic approach (to sound pretentious). Its minimalist soundtrack, composed by Gustavo Santaolalla, is beautiful; the graphics and art design are gorgeous, perfectly showing how nature can overcome a post-apocalyptic world with some of the most-stunning graphics for the time (and that hold up rather well); and above all else, the story is nothing less than extraordinary. At first glance, it’s bland; man must protect and escort girl. Pretty boring, right? But by the end of the game, you have laughed with these characters, you have gotten angry with these characters, you have cried with these characters, and you have rooted for everything to work out for them. The sequel also excels in all these areas, but where it changes things is how it makes you feel.<br /><br />The first game has you commit horrific acts, but because it can make for fun gameplay and it is usually in the name of self-defense, you can accept it. The sequel is dark. It is depressing. It toys with your emotions with its approach to story and characters. Like the first game, the gameplay is fun – more on that later – but the actions you as a player are forced to commit are horrific. This is where it really proves its necessity as a game and not a miniseries or some other visual medium. One scene, in particular, has you interrogating an infected person i.e., someone who is going to die no matter what. You want information. The game doesn’t show anything too graphic because the camera shifts to look at your character’s face, but you must hit the button, multiple times, to get this information. It doesn’t last long because it cuts to black after a bit, but you don’t get to shy away from these awful acts. If you want to see where this story goes and what happens to these characters that you’ve grown to love, you have to partake in these events. It’s messed up, maybe even too much for some people, but as a piece of art, and more specifically as a video game, it is amazing.<br /><br />It’s hard to talk about this game in detail without revealing spoilers, but if you go in with an open-mind, it’s good. Like, really good. It is definitely one of the greatest gaming experiences for me personally. But if you are one of those people who are expecting a certain story and will be upset if it doesn’t happen your way, you will loathe this game. It doesn’t conform to audience expectations. It tells a certain story the way it wants to tell it and fully commits. You have to give it a chance. There are some bold narrative decisions, but they help propel the story forward, make it different than the first game (if you want the same game, just go play the original), and make you not only agree with your characters’ decisions, but also disagree and feel conflicted with their decisions. That’s what is great about it. It doesn’t pull punches and doesn’t try to be something it is not. It is a dark tale about dark events with characters who are emotionally tortured. That’s not to say there aren’t beautiful, touching moments – there absolutely are – but they are brief releases from the extremely violent nature of the game. The game is unrelentingly harsh, but I applaud the willingness to commit.<br /><br />However, being a game, there are gameplay aspects to discuss. That being said, nobody in their right mind would play this game without having a strong connection with the story, so I’ll keep it brief. Basically, it’s the same as the first game, but polished and better because of it. You can now go prone and sneak in grass, craft more items and use different weapons, face new and improved AI, and really just get a more cinematic (there’s that word again) combat experience that feels so fluid, largely because of how slick the animations are. It’s genuinely fun to play. Walking into an area that is filled with enemy patrols or infected (i.e., zombies), slowly taking some out, getting caught, then frantically trying to find cover as you kill some with your shotgun and toss a Molotov or two, only to go back in stealth and repeat the process creates some of the most exhilarating gameplay experiences out there. I can’t do it justice with words alone, but needless to say, it is not just an interactive movie – this is a game, through and through.<br /><br />The game even toys with your gaming expectations, with two notable examples coming to mind. The first is when I heard horrific sounds in an area, which led to my character automatically pulling out their gun. The level also started featuring ammo supply drops and showed my current health, signifying an encounter was about to take place. Then nothing happens. But I wasn’t disappointed because that tense feeling I got was special – I was on the edge of my seat and shocked that nothing happened, and it was wonderful. The other scenario was the opposite. I was in a safe zone upgrading my weapons and, out of the blue, a couple enemies come out and attack me. It was deceiving of the game to attack me while my guard was down during what is almost always a safe zone, but it genuinely shocked me and made me scramble to survive. It was amazing, and I loved it.<br /><br />My only real complaint with the game is something that I have seen few people bring up and if they do, it’s usually complimentary, but I think it is a legitimate criticism. Naughty Dog has been adding more and more open levels to their games for some time now, basically since the first Last of Us (they have had a full-fledged Uncharted game and expansion pack since then). While their games are still very much linear and definitely nowhere near open-world, there are some very open areas that can take some time to explore. I, unlike most people, dislike these because while it is cool to have that sense of freedom, it destroys pacing to be walking around a huge area for an hour or more trying to explore every nook and cranny. Yeah, it’s not required, but you are really missing out if you don’t explore, both in terms of gameplay items and supplies and sweet character interactions. The linearity of Naughty Dog games creates not just tight stories, but great pacing, and so I am not the biggest fan of these more open levels, even if they are well-designed and reward the player for exploring. But I digress, this is not the biggest deal for me and certainly not for most people.<br /><br />On another note, the game has the most accessibility options of probably any game ever. Most of the settings weren’t important for me, so I can’t confirm how accessible they make the game to more disabled players, but they seemed to have put a genuine effort into making this game playable by as many people as possible. That’s really cool. I even used some of the features myself. I don’t want to constantly tap a button to pick up supplies, so I turned on auto pickup. I hate mashing a button to get out of an enemy’s grasp, so I turned on a feature that just let me hold a button. There are so many features that I strongly encourage you to look through them all to see if there’s anything that can make the game a little more enjoyable for you. You can even adjust the difficulty on a detailed level! I played on moderate, but I found myself having way too many supplies and being quite overpowered, so I kept the enemies on that same difficulty, but turned the supply drop to hard. It made it more fun, which is what games are meant to be. This level of accessibility and player-choice should be encouraged, and I hope that other developers take notice.<br /><br />The Last of Us Part II is excellent, really superb. At the very least, even if someone ends up hating the game, it’s worth playing soon (if you enjoyed the first) to be part of the discussion taking place. I think a lot of the hate is unwarranted, but despite my love of it, there are some very understandable points I have heard, including comments on the structure of the narrative. I didn’t have a problem with it, but that is a fascinating, legitimate counterpoint. I think that the real beauty of this game is that it created a discourse. Some of it is hate-filled and immature on so many levels, but some of it is intellectual and honest and makes you not ashamed to play games. Love or hate it in the end, this game has made so many people jump to the internet and post their thoughts. At the end of the day, isn’t that what art is supposed to do? Make you want to talk about it and discuss it with friends, and even strangers? The Last of Us Part II does that. It succeeds.

While not as popular as Insomniac’s Ratchet and Clank series, Naughty’s Dog’s own dynamic duo had a trilogy of great games that deserve a little more love. Sure, the gunplay isn’t as refined as the Ratchet series and the platforming may not be as fun as jumping and hitting the circle button in Sucker Punch’s own Sly Cooper series, but I stand by these games being epic adventures that more people should play. I’ve already written a review on the first two games, but here are my summarized thoughts: the first game, while short and easy, is one of the best collectathons out there and serves as a fitting conclusion to the golden age of 3D platformers. The second game, although frustratingly difficult and not quite as fun in the gameplay department because of this, is a solid sequel that is a great example of how to evolve a series gameplay and add a far more intricate storyline with fully-fleshed out characters. To this day, I would say that Jak II has one of the best stories for a PS2-era game. So where does this third game stand? Does it hold up to the gameplay greatness of the first game or the engrossing tale of the second? Well, no. But is it my favorite in the trilogy? Well, yeah, it is.<br /><br />While Jak 3 doesn’t flip its gameplay on its head like the second game did, it fixes just enough problems to make it a far more enjoyable gaming experience. Firstly, the game is much, much easier to get through. While I wouldn’t say the game is as easy as the first game, the checkpoint system is far better than the second, no longer forcing players to replay long segments of missions just because you missed a jump or died in a painful minigame – well, for the most part, there are still a few annoying segments like this, but nothing major. As much as I hate to say it, that’s the main reason I prefer this game to the second. The story isn’t as good (more on that later) and although I like many of the gameplay additions (again, more on that later), it’s mainly because I can actually get through large chunks of the game without losing any hair. It’s just fun, plain and simple.<br /><br />One added element includes a new location, Spargus City and its surrounding desert. Within the walls of Spargus, you can ride leaper lizards to quickly get around and let me tell you, these guys control way better than the stupid zoomers of the last game. You eventually get back to (a smaller) Haven City and use the zoomers, but they are not an integral part of the game, thankfully. When you’re in the desert, however, you get to control these badass-looking dune buggies and they’re a mixed bag. Half the time, you feel awesome riding these bad boys throughout the desert wasteland as the harsh storms blow in your face and the other half of the time, you’re getting pissed off because the terrain is far too rough far too often and you’re constantly being attacked by enemy vehicles during most missions. I loved the concept of driving around in the desert wasteland, but I definitely think the execution could have been better. Also, the jet board makes a return and is still fun to do tricks with; thankfully, you can now stun nearby enemies by pressing the circle button when riding. Not a huge deal, but a nice touch. But that’s not all the new elements here!<br /><br />Jak also gets some new powers to balance out his dark self. Fittingly, his new form is called Light Jak and uses Light Eco. Throughout the game, you get the powers of healing (part of what makes the game a lot easier, which I’m OK with), time-freeze (mainly for a few platforming bits), a spherical shield (I never used it), and brief flight (gotten late in the game and also allows for some fun platforming segments). These powers are pretty cool, but in addition to that, you also get eight new morph gun mods, including two more for each eco color. A few of my favorites include the Needle Lazer (a homing weapon with a rapid rate-of-fire), the Beam Reflexor (the same as the simple Blaster, but now bullets ricochet, creating one of the most overpowered weapons in the game, but it’s still fun and looks awesome). This brings the total number of weapons in the game to twelve and while most of them are fun to use, it also leads into what might be a flaw for some players – too many options.<br /><br />I think one of the strengths in this game is the amount of variety, but it’s easy to see how some might be turned off by this. It’s great that you have all these powers, Light and Dark, and that the weapon list has been expanded, but there’s not a great chance you’ll get use out of most of them throughout the game. With the second game, each weapon or power was a big deal and felt special, but now you get so many and don’t get to fully appreciate all of them. That’s not to say I dislike these weapons or powers, as many of them are cool and fun to use, it’s just that the game is really not that long (about 9 hours, give or take). Thankfully, there’s a new game plus mode that allows you to toy with them a bit more, but I don’t think that fixes the problem. Also, there are so many minigames. Again, I think it spices things up and there and there are some genuinely enjoyable ones like having Daxter ride a missile through the port, using a turret to destroy giant wasteland metalheads as Sig drives you around, or flying your own hovercar in the sky as you destroy a robot war factory. These are really fun, but much like Jak II, it does make you miss some of the platforming segments of the first game. One of my favorite levels in Jak II is the Mountain Temple area, mainly because of its platforming focus and similarly, I love the volcano/monk temple levels in this game because they have a fun focus on platforming (even including a couple segments where you get to play as Daxter) and some more puzzle-oriented elements (it’s also where you get all your Light powers in the game). I, personally, love the variety in this game and its a huge reason why it’s my favorite in the series, but I do think that it could turn off some people. That about covers the gameplay, so how’s the story?<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot is not nearly as engaging as Jak II mainly because it goes all over the place. Jak is banished to the wasteland? Metalheads are back? There are robots now? The world is ending? What? Much like with its gameplay, it lacks focus. That being said, I do think that one of the major benefits of this is the grander scale. Yeah, you’re trying to save the world again, but it feels more important this time because of all these different threats and everything being thrown at you. There’s also a bigger emphasis on the Precursors themselves, as they not only give Jak his new Light powers throughout the game, but you also get to meet them at the end. As one of the animators said on an unlockable commentary track, half of the players will hate this and half will love it – I loved it and thought they did a great job of having it fit the game world without ruining the tone. Many feel differently, but I loved the twist. But aside from the plot, the characterization is really strong in this game.<br /><br />Jak has matured and is not revenge-hungry like the last game, so he’s a lot more interesting (although I liked him in the last game, too). A new character, Damas, is the king of Spargus and takes on a mentor role to Jak and he’s pretty cool – by the end of the game, his relationship with Jak became one of my favorite parts of the series. Then there’s a new antagonist, Count Veger, who is wonderfully played by Phil LaMarr (also the voice of Sig and many TV show characters). He’s a complete dick, but a fun character because of his pompous “I am superior to all” attitude. There are some other new characters, but these two stand out in the new department. Most of the old characters return and although not everyone gets a huge part, they make just enough of an appearance to show us that they’re not forgotten. I love that Torn respects Jak a lot more (which makes sense since Jak did save the world last game). The only part about characterization that really bugs me is that Keira gets next to no speaking lines and is replaced by Ashelin as the new romantic interest for Jak. This is silly because it was implied last game that Torn and Ashelin were romantically linked, not to mention that Keira and Jak have been flirting for two whole games now. The voice actress for Keira was also changed for this game, so I don’t know what happened (if anything) behind-the-scenes, but this is the only major part of the story I don’t like. But it’s such a small part that I don’t mind. Also, since I’m nitpicking, why would Damas pit Sig and Jak, two of his best fighters, in the arena and order one to kill the other? If it was random, it’s still stilly, but I digress. These are minor nitpicks in what is an otherwise grand adventure.<br /><br />When it comes down to it, I can basically summarize the trilogy as follows: the first game has the best gameplay because of its strong focus on platforming, while the second has the best story. The third is a jack-of-all-trades, master of none. The gameplay is more forgiving than the second and varied, which is nice, but its lack of focus makes it weaker than the first. Similarly, the story’s grand scale makes it far more exciting than the first game’s, especially since Naughty Dog always has great animators and hires solid actors, but it’s not as tight as the second. Even the music has the same dilemma; it’s lacks the funky soundtrack of the first game but has a kickass main theme, whereas Jak II had little memorable music. So really, this isn’t my favorite in the trilogy because it excels in any one area, but because it takes the best from the previous two games to create an experience that is fun to play and enjoyable to see unfold. It’s for this reason that I consider Jak 3 to be Naughty Dog’s flawed epic. If I had to rank it on a list with other Naughty Dog games, I’d probably put it at number four, right behind Uncharted 2 and 4, and The Last of Us. A worthy game that deserves a little more love outside of its cult following, I’d say. It’s great to see how Naughty Dog evolved over the years, from platforming fun in Crash to platforming fun mixed with more mature themes in Jak, to less platforming and more “realism” in Uncharted, to the dark and gritty game that is The Last of Us. These games really are the transition period for Naughty Dog and it’s really cool to see that take place. If you haven’t played the trilogy, then get off your ass and go play it – you’ll be in for a bumpy but helluva fun ride.", "ParentASIN": "B00020LZAM", "Timestamp": 1565569717560, "ItemName": "Jak 3 - PlayStation 2", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.6, "RatingCount": 448, "Price": 14.86, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation 2", "Games"], "Description": "Jak now features upgradeable mods to enhance firepower and strategic gameplay.

While many fans were saddened to see Nate’s journey come to an end, most (including myself) were happy to see the series go out in style as one of 2016’s greatest games. However, despite Nathan’s story coming to a close, Naughty Dog did announce that there would be a DLC for the game, focusing on a different character. For months, this is what fans were led to believe, but what was originally meant to be a short DLC for the main game, akin to Left Behind for The Last of Us, eventually evolved into its own game that could be played independently. To add icing to the cake, Naughty Dog even decided to make Chloe, a fan-favorite if there ever was one, the protagonist of this new game. After over a year, the game has finally been released and although it is no Uncharted 4 (which nobody should be expecting), it is a solid entry to the Uncharted series and a superb gaming experience from start to finish.<br /><br /> I say that the game is superb even from the get go, and I mean exactly that. Once the game loads to the main menu, it is instantly recognizable as a Naughty Dog game. You have beautiful scenery as the background for the menu alongside some great music (courtesy of returning composer Henry Jackman) and it really gets the player pumped for the game. Once you begin the game, you are treated to a cut-scene featuring Chloe and a little girl and right away, I was hooked into this game; the beautiful visuals, the acting of the characters (Claudia Black kills it as Chloe), and the interesting dialogue between the two people make the opening as interesting as it could be. Naughty Dog has always excelled at presentation and this game is no different, providing some of the most cinematic storytelling in the entire medium. Speaking of story, this game has a pretty good one.<br /><br /> First and foremost, the game does not have the emotional impact of Uncharted 4, if only because it doesn’t feature Nathan Drake. While that might sound like a complaint, it really isn’t; Naughty Dog is still able to deliver a captivating story to its players. Like most of their games, the plot is relatively simple and straightforward, but the writing and acting of the characters make it very exciting despite this. I’ve mentioned that Claudia Black does her part extremely well, but so does Laura Bailey as Nadine Ross, providing an effective foil for our main character. Like Last of Us, a huge part of this story revolves around the characters interacting and eventually getting emotionally close with each other (although it obviously isn’t nearly as close as Joel and Ellie’s relationship). Without spoiling anything, I’ll just say that it might be very predictable, but it is still enjoyable to see the relationship unfold before you. On the other side of the spectrum, we have Asav (the main antagonist), who is the leader of a local group of rebels, and he is excellently performed by Usman Ally. Like Rafe Adler of Uncharted 4, he doesn’t receive too much screen time, but he does make an impact with what we do see. I would say that he is about as good of a villain as Lazarevic was in the second game – he’s cliché in a lot of ways, but the performance and motion capture make him entertaining nonetheless. Overall, I enjoyed the story, but I just want to quickly mention that there is a plot twist roughly halfway through the game that I greatly enjoyed. It makes the relationships much more interesting and provides the story with a nice ‘oomph’ to keep the player engaged for the second half. As always, Uncharted excels in this area, but what about the gameplay?<br /><br /> Because this isn’t a completely new game in the series and reuses many of the same elements from Uncharted 4, there isn’t a whole lot new in the gameplay department, but again, this isn’t a complaint. I loved the gameplay of the main game and the couple tweaks they added to this game were enough to keep me interested. The big addition is lock picking, which I enjoyed a lot more than I originally thought I would. It might seem gimmicky, but I think it works rather well – you simply go up to a lock/lockbox, press triangle, and rotate the analog stick until the controller vibrates and you pick the lock. It’s very intuitive and because of the useful rewards (usually rare weapons), it’s worth it. It gets especially tense when you are trying to unlock a weapons crate in the middle of a firefight because you want to get that one special gun, so this simple system worked out very well. The only other major additions that I noticed were the addition of new guns, such as the amazing silenced pistol and C4, which are fun to use. The game doesn’t feature that many new gameplay elements, but this isn’t a problem; however, the collectible system is changed slightly.<br /><br /> As far as collectibles go, there are still treasures and optional conversations, along with the added photo opportunity spots (go to a spot and press triangle to take a picture with Chloe’s phone) and 23 lockboxes throughout the game. These work about the same as they did in the main game, but the game also features what is probably the biggest level in the series. This level is chapter four and it is both awesome and not-so awesome. It is essentially a bigger version of the Madagascar level, except instead of following a mostly linear path, the player now has the option to choose which towers he or she wants to explore and in what order. This is great if you’re just playing for the story, but if you are a perfectionist like me, this does make the game feel a little slow during this chapter. The main (optional) collectibles for this area are eleven tokens and collecting all of them gives you a reward that makes your controller speaker ding when there is nearby treasure. While I appreciate this reward, instead of just making a virtual PSN trophy the only incentive, I don’t think it is worth it. Even with this item, I still missed some treasures and am going to end up using a guide anyways, but I suppose it is better to have a lackluster reward than no reward at all. For the most part, this chapter works just fine, but it does depend on your taste in linearity and nonlinearity in games.<br /><br /> So, that’s it! I highly recommend the game to all Uncharted fans, unless you hated the fourth game, which is beyond weird. I’m not sure if I would recommend it to those who haven’t played any games in the series, so if you are new, I would just recommend the Nathan Drake Collection first and go from there. This game isn’t revolutionary by any means, but for a $40 title that was originally meant to be DLC, it is really good. I can’t stand seeing reviews (*cough* IGN *cough*) that criticize this for being more of the same when that is all you should have been expecting. I’m not giving this game five stars because it is an amazing triple-A game that is on the same level as Uncharted, but I am giving this five stars because it met my expectations and I’ll happily replay it when I go through the whole series again. If you’re a fan of these games, this title definitely deserves your attention.<br /><br />EDIT: It took me approximately 8.5 hours to complete this game, but I took my time. Even if you don't explore nearly as much as I did, you should still expect a solid 6-hour adventure with the same replay value as Uncharted 4.", "ParentASIN": "B074Y47R4P", "Timestamp": 1550424994634, "ItemName": "Uncharted: The Lost Legacy PlayStation 4", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.2, "RatingCount": 63, "Price": null, "Categories": [], "Description": "From the acclaimed developer of The Last of Us and Uncharted 4, a new action-packed adventure follows Chloe Frazer as she teams up with mercenary Nadine Ross to recover a legendary Indian artefact and thwart a war profiteer.

The days of jumping around on precarious platforms to collect some shiny objects while mowing down dozens of cartoony enemies in a goofy fashion is nothing more than an ancient memory of a time long past. How I miss the days of playing as my purple dragon, Spyro, and collecting the various dragon eggs with my brothers in the innocent age of childhood. What’s that you say? A remaster? Preposterous! Why would a remake of a series that has been dead (in my eyes) for years all of a sudden be commissioned? Oh, the Crash Bandicoot remake sold really well and we are living in an age of remasters galore? Well, in that case, I’m happy that Spyro is being rebuilt from the ground up for my nostalgic viewing experience, but I don’t want to support more remasters when we should be encouraging creativity from our developers. But wait, there’s more?! The remaster is superb? One of the best I’ve ever played? And it strikes a perfect balance between capturing the nostalgic feeling of mine and many others’ childhood whilst also refining many aspects of the game to make it enjoyable for new gamers? Well, to that I say: On to Dragon Shores we go!<br /><br />If you couldn’t tell from my glamorous introduction, I am a huge fan of the original Spyro trilogy. I’ve played some of the other ones (from the terrible Enter the Dragonfly to the questionable Legend series), but my love has always been for Insomniac Games’ classic trilogy. While I will fully admit to being blinded by the powerful drug of nostalgia, I still consider the third game, Year of the Dragon, to be the epitome of 3D platforming games and a perfect capstone for the declining genre (since it was released in 2000 at the end of the PlayStation One’s life-cycle). That being said, each game does have its own pros and cons and I enjoy them all. But how is this remaster? As I alluded to above, I love it – like, really love it! As one gets older, they have less and less time to devote to the culture of gaming, so take this with a grain of salt, but it’s been one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I’ve had in a long time. It may not have the sophisticated storytelling of God of War or the couch co-op fun of the new Smash Bros., but it has some dang fun and addicting gameplay and that’s all I really ask for in a platforming game.<br /><br />To start, I’m going to give a brief overview of what I think are the strengths and weaknesses of each game. I was surprised by how playing through this version, completing each game back-to-back, changed my opinion of the series. I used to think that the series got progressively better, mainly because of the greater variety in gameplay in each game, and that it peaked with the third game. Now, however, I don’t necessarily believe that. While the original game lacks the flair of dozens of minigames that its sequels have to offer, I very much appreciated the simple system of “Play as Spyro and only Spyro” in it. The only real minigames are the various time trials, which are great fun, and much like the original Crash Bandicoot, there’s something to be said for a platforming game that focuses on, of all things, platforming. The next game, Ripto’s Rage, is probably my least favorite of the series. To the best of my knowledge, the most popular game of the series is either this game or the third and while I still very much enjoyed this game, the overabundance of minigames made it slightly less enjoyable for me. There are some really fun minigames, mind you, but for every couple fun ones comes a dud that is either a pain or bore to go through. But it was still a fun game and it had a huge impact on the third game, which I believe was the perfect balance.<br /><br />Year of the Dragon has a lot of minigames as well, but I think that not only are they more fun, but they are also complemented by the addition of numerous characters. As a huge fan of the, at its peak, amazing Tony Hawk series, I loved the skateboarding levels in this game – easily one of my favorite video game levels from childhood is the skating area from the level Sunny Villa. And all the new characters are awesome, from the simple Sheila the kangaroo and Bentley the yeti to the more explosive Sgt. James Byrd the penguin and Agent 9 the crazy monkey. You even get to play as Sparx the dragonfly in really fun top-down shooter levels (also some of my favorite levels). It’s not perfect, but I consider Year of the Dragon to be a masterpiece in its genre of gaming. But chances are if you’re reading this review, then you have already played the original games (and probably bought the remaster), so what about this version?<br /><br />This remaster/remake/whatever you want to call it is simply stunning. I mean, just look at it?! It’s beautiful. I can understand how people might be worried about taking a beloved series like this and redesigning most of the characters and world for the current generation, but as someone who has a strong bias for the original versions of these games, I love the redesigns. Most of the characters look the same, with Spyro and his little jog that he does being more adorable than ever, and the ones that look different are fine with me. For example, most of the dragons in the first game have original designs to not only set them apart (instead of just being slightly different sizes and colors), but also to show that they are different types of dragons. From the cultured Artisans to the exotic Dream Weavers, each world has their own distinct style of dragons and, to add icing to this already delicious cake, most have their own unique animations and style of speaking to further individualize them. Whenever Spyro frees them, the usual quick-conversation happens, but it feels more cinematic when it happens because of these changes. This isn’t something that had to be included in the game to make it great, but I greatly appreciate that Toys for Bob (the developer) went the extra mile. As a whole, I love the new art style, with the ending credits making me wish there was a 2D animated Spyro series as it features some stunning artwork of our mischievous little dragon. From a purely visual perspective, this game is extraordinarily well-done, but what about the gameplay? How does it feel (as Bob Dylan would say)?<br /><br />It feels better than ever. Again, speaking from experience as someone who has fully completed these games multiple times, I had almost no problems adjusting to the gameplay here. It feels as smooth as butter in almost every area, from just moving around Spyro to flying with him in the time trial levels. They even added a few new features that make the game more enjoyable. Firstly, the rolling feature (originally only part of the first game) is now available in all games. Secondly, skill points are in the first game (instead of just the latter two). Thirdly, Sparx can now point to missing treasure from the get-go instead of having to unlock that ability partway through the final game. Lastly, and this one seems trivial but makes all the difference to me, you can now fully control the camera in the Agent 9 levels, making it feel more like a classic third-person shooter a la Ratchet and Clank than an 18-year-old game from an era without dual-analog sticks. While some of these changes might upset perfectionists, I loved these additions and think that having them here as options only helps the game.<br /><br />My only minor quibble about the gameplay concerns Spyro’s hovering, which he is able to do at the end of a glide in the latter two games. Most of the time it works splendidly and feels great (and looks cool, too), but every once in a while, Spyro would just drop down instead of hovering, causing mild annoyance and/or the loss of a life, depending on the situation. I don’t know the exact reason for this, but my guess is that it has something to do with the fact that there is no hovering in the first game and hitting that button causes Spyro to drop; something must have not been programmed properly and caused some errors. It didn’t ruin my experience by any means, as it only happened about 5-10 times, but I felt obligated to mention it. Also, I have to mention that the loading times each time you die are annoying. I didn’t think that it was a big enough complaint to mention at first, but it did annoy me by the end of the game, so I’m mentioning it now. Any other criticisms concerning the gameplay are problems that were in the original games, such as a finnicky camera (although having dual-analog sticks does alleviate much of this problem, so it’s not that bad). Overall, it’s very solid.<br /><br />Moving on, I want to mention a few tidbits of information that may concern cautious buyers. Firstly, the remixed soundtrack sounds great to me, but I’m no music aficionado, so you may disagree. If you absolutely hate the new music or just want pure nostalgia (how many times have I used that word?), then the original soundtrack is an option, which I think was a great decision (the original version of Midnight Mountain’s theme is still one of my favorite video game themes). Secondly, most of the voice cast is different. While I love hearing Tom Kenny as Spyro say lines originally spoken by Carlos Alazraqui in the first game, I would be lying if I said I didn’t miss the original voices. For example, Neil Ross voicing Moneybags in the third game – he was just perfect for the role. However, if we ignore my bias for a second, I can honestly say that the new cast does a great job and you can tell that they’re really enthusiastic in their roles. JB Blanc, the new Moneybags, grew on me by the end of the game and although I could never replace the original, he does an outstanding job as the brazenly avaricious, duplicitous, larcenous ursine. Finally, I fully completed everything in this trilogy in about 23.5 half-hours, so if you’re concerned about bang-for-your-buck, you’re certainly getting it here (I imagine that it would take a new player more time).<br /><br />Now, just for the heck of it, I’m going to list some of my favorite levels so that you can see what exactly these games have to offer and why I love them (there are 101 levels across all three games, FYI). For the first game, I love the entire Dream Weavers world, with its wacky level and character designs providing one of the most entertaining set of levels in the entire series. For the second game, I love the levels of Zephyr and Breeze Harbor, although not because of their actual level design. Rather, in each level the enemies Spyro fights are the heroes from the other level. So, in Zephyr, Spyro helps the Land-Blubbers defeat the Breezebuilder birds, but in Breeze Harbor, it’s the opposite. This creates a darkly comical situation where you have to sit and think to yourself “Is Spyro some sort of sicko by playing on both sides of a war?” Insomniac Games has always had this sort of black humor in their games and I love it!<br /><br />For the third game, there’s a few: Spooky Swamp is great simply because all the characters speak in haikus, which is objectively awesome; Fireworks Factory features one of the catchiest themes in the series and provides for a really exciting and action-packed level with flying, fireballs, spies, and a great Agent 9 FPS area; Frozen Altars is probably my favorite level in the entire collection because it features a unique premise in that Spyro gets an ice breath powerup that lasts for the entirety of the level, something not done in any other area. This unique situation makes for a really entertaining level and it doesn’t hurt that it features one of my favorite themes (seriously, look it up). And of course, all of the bonus levels rewarded for achieving 100% in each game is awesome, from Gnasty’s Loot (which allows flight throughout the entire level), to Dragon Shores (a relaxing level that acts as a mini-carnival), to the final level in the game, Super Bonus Round (which features flying, skating, and a submarine area) – some of the best levels are here!<br /><br />Spyro: Reignited Trilogy is one of my favorite games not only for allowing me to play one of my favorite series in one glorious HD collection, but also for the pure joy it has given me. No game is perfect, and I don’t claim that any of these games are without flaws, but there’s a certain intangible quality that these games give me, a certain sense of calming satisfaction. People change and as one gets older, it becomes harder and harder to remain attached to things of the past since we change throughout the years, but this collection has given me a great feeling that I feel words cannot aptly describe. If you haven’t played these games before, I doubt that you’ll feel as passionate as I do, but I wish you enjoyment nonetheless. But if you have those same memories that I do of chasing down those taunting thieves who stole the dragon eggs, then I know that you’ll enjoy this game as much as I did. I only wish that I could do it all again for the first time.

From the classic RPG mechanics inspired by Dungeons and Dragons and the like to fun hack ‘n’ slash games meant to give you a sense of satisfaction from pulling off crazy combos, games are as diverse – if not more so – than any other art form. Heck, gaming probably features all the art forms that a movie has plus the ones that are exclusive to gaming. If a developer wants to make a thriller story like Silence of the Lambs but also throw in some classic platforming gameplay, nothing is stopping them. And while it is great that the medium can have such a diverse way of expressing itself, this also creates the problem of leading some people to become disappointed when a particular genre becomes too popular. For example, some people (such as myself) are not the biggest fan of battle royale multiplayer games like Fortnite, but I would take a PlayStation platformer like Spyro or Sly Cooper any day of the week. While this will always leave some disappointed, I think that it is best looked at through the lens of “Well, at least some groups are happy.”<br /><br />This new God of War, developed by Sony Santa Monica Studio (who developed all the previous main titles in the series), marks quite the change for the beloved franchise. No longer are you playing as Kratos, a god seeking revenge in a fast-paced action-adventure hack ‘n’ slash that lets players live out their wildest fantasies of slashing gods and titans; instead, you play as Kratos, a widower and father who is trying to live a simple life in a game that, while still featuring many combat scenarios, has a far greater emphasis on story, characters, and exploration than previous games. I’ve read many discussion threads and articles online that praise this new direction the franchise is taking, but also quite a few that dismiss it because “it’s not God of War.” While I personally agree with the former, I think that it is best to discuss this game as its own being – it isn’t a total reboot (this is the same Kratos in the same storyline), but it is certainly a rebirth of the franchise. And as far as the developers’ goal in trying to breathe new life into a series that some thought had its glory days behind it, they not only succeed but also create one of the most beautiful, touching, grand, and just plain fun experiences of this gaming generation. THIS is God of War<br /><br /> Due to the popularity of the game and the amount of press it has already gotten (not to mention that this review is super late), I’m not going to spend much time dwelling on the mechanics and common knowledge of the game. It’s a third-person action-adventure game with a heavy focus on story and characters and exploration (like I said earlier) and features inspiration from many popular games, such as The Last of Us, Tomb Raider, Dark Souls, and probably dozens of others that I haven’t had the chance to play. What makes this game so great is that it takes some of the best elements from each of these franchises and mixes it all together to create its own cohesive experience. For example, the over-the-shoulder camera and basic movement is clearly inspired by Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us. This was probably done because that particular style helps with immersion greatly without going into full-out first-person mode. You could also say that having a strong focus on story, especially with a parental figure and child, is also reminiscent of that game. That’s great, seeing as how the main reason that The Last of Us is popular is because of its story and characters. But for those who didn’t like The Last of Us (those heartless bastards), calling this game “Dad of Us: God of War Meets The Last of Us,” you’re doing the game a great disservice.<br /><br /> While I’m confident in saying that the game developers did take note from The Last of Us, it’s not the only inspiration they took. The core combat system, which is decidedly different from past games, seems to take a Dark Souls-esque approach. Don’t take that the wrong way, it’s not a copy-and-paste approach, as there are still over-the-top moves you can perform (including some sick finishers and powerful runic attacks), but the base system of blocking with your shield and parrying when an enemy attacks to get an opening gives you that similar feeling. This is most prevalent in the early segments of the game when your character isn’t upgraded fully and you don’t have access to dozens of powerful moves and while I absolutely love decimating my foes with those attacks, the beginning parts makes you take a step back and be cautious with your fights – the first true boss fight of the game is probably the most difficult part of the story because of this fact. You can’t just button-mash your way to victory (at least not on normal difficulty) and I appreciated that thought put into the combat. I should mention, however, that because the combat takes this route while also utilizing a similar camera to The Last of Us, it can feel a little clunky at times and hard to control, especially in the beginning when you’re still getting used to everything, but after getting a couple hours into the game, you start to get the hang of it and it should be (mostly) smooth sailing from there on out – no camera in a game is perfect, but I still very much enjoyed the combat here. But then there’s the exploration.<br /><br /> The game seems to be a balance between linear and nonlinear, and I don’t think that it is fair to label it as either of them. To say that the game is a nonlinear open-world game isn’t completely true, as it’s certainly no Elder Scrolls or GTA in this regard, but to say that it is a linear game like Uncharted or the previous games is also unfair, as there are plenty of optional areas to explore on your journey. In this regard, I find it similar to metroidvania games and the newer Tomb Raider games. I only played the 2013 one, but it’s similar in that there is a linear path that you can take for the story, but there are plenty of side areas to explore to fill your time (although this game has far more content than Tomb Raider). While I almost always prefer linear games over nonlinear ones (for many reasons that I don’t want to get into for the sake of time), I find that this game does a nice balance of staying in the middle. The main story is obviously the selling point of the game and certainly met my expectations, but the side content is jolly good fun as well, especially since you can learn more about the world you inhabit by exploring various landscapes and discovering secret areas and lore markers. That being said, however, I must offer one of my nitpicks of the game: the pacing.<br /><br /> One of the best parts about a linear game is that by focusing on a single path for the player, it is (usually) more focused and can allow for a great experience that doesn’t get old too quickly, i.e., it has really good pacing and means you don’t get bored. By having this game be a little more open-ended you get the benefit of having more replay value on a single playthrough, more places to visit, and more customizable options for your characters because you do more, but you sacrifice something that I think is more important: the pacing. One minute, you’re battling giant creatures and experiencing a riveting father-son tale with spectacular set pieces and beautiful subtle moments and the next, you’re doing slightly repetitive side quests so that you can upgrade your equipment and learn more about the world. Now I understand that the keyword here is that it is optional content that no one is forcing you to do right away, but the game seems to deliberately encourage you to explore – that’s how you get some of the best loot in the game and there are even moments where Atreus (your son) specifically says lines like “We should go exploring now.” I know that not everyone will feel this way and many would probably think that I’m nitpicking what isn’t even a flaw, but it’s just something that I thought should be stated because it honestly bugged me a bit in my playthrough. But that being said, it is a super nitpick and I would like to get to the other important aspect of the game now: the story.<br /><br /> God of War is yet another fantastic example for the argument of why video games are the best medium for presenting a story. Directed by Cory Balrog, the game continues the cinematic approach of the earlier games – however, instead of using the cinematic framework to create over-the-top moments with some decent story bits sprinkled here and there, they use the framework to create a more natural experience where it really lets the player feel like they are truly embarking on journey. As I stated earlier, the camera is a lot closer to Kratos this time around and by not having any camera cuts in the game, you are part of every step of Kratos’ journey as he and his son travel to the highest peak so that they may spread their mother’s ashes. Although the game has its grand moments that harken back to past games, the game is a lot more subdued in its approach as some of the best moments are just the little things you notice. Walking through the forest, Atreus might pose a question and Kratos’ response alone can provide more character depth than entire cutscenes in the past games, which is a tribute to the writing of this game. I do think that by having many people (including myself) compare this game to The Last of Us, you might create expectations for what the story should be and while I personally don’t think that it is quite as good, it is still a beautiful journey from beginning to end that, while not featuring the greatest story or characters in a game, still features some of my favorite.<br /><br /> Perhaps most shockingly, Kratos is great. Before this game, I was not a huge fan of him as I felt that he was just an angry dude who blamed everyone else for his problems, but this game makes you genuinely care about this man and his path to not only being a good father to Atreus, but also to redemption (even if he doesn’t realize it). Then there’s Atreus who is a great sidekick to have around. Since I’m already making comparisons, I supposed I should mention that he’s not a copy-and-paste of Ellie, but he is certainly likeable and also very useful in combat – I don’t know where I’d be without his magic arrows. There’s plenty of other great side characters, but I don’t want to give them all away – needless to say, I think that all of them were fantastic. My two favorite were the main villain (who is perfect as the jackass who you can’t help but love watching on-screen) and a character who appears halfway through the game to help provide you with some information – he’s both funny and great at imparting knowledge to you and your son. All the actors perform exceptionally well, but I want to give particular mention to Christopher Judge. Some were hesitant that he was taking over the role of Kratos from long-time actor Terrence C. Carson, but he does a fantastic job. I won’t comment on who is better, as I think they both fit their respective eras very well, but for representing all that Kratos is (a man with a dark a past, a mourning husband, a trying father, an unbelievably strong god, etc.), he is nothing short of fantastic.<br /><br /> Since this review is getting a little longer than I was originally planning, I would like to mention a small detail that many (including myself at one point) asked: Is it necessary to play the past games? While the game is marketed as taking a fresh start of the series and was developed with that attitude, I think that it is important to mention that this is still the same Kratos and while it doesn’t continue from the exact point that God of War III left off, it is a continuation of the story of Kratos. Not every question is answered, but there are more than a couple callbacks to Kratos’ past that I’m not sure would be appreciated if you didn’t play the previous games. However, that being said, I think that it would be interesting to play the game without this outside knowledge because then you would be more curious about some aspects and see certain situations through the eyes of Atreus (which director Cory Balrog has mentioned as being a perfectly suitable experience). So, I guess my answer would be if you have access to the previous games and want to play them, play them first; but if you’re not interested and just want to play this game, just jump into this one (or watch YouTube summaries of the previous games and then play this one if you want).<br /><br />God of War is a great game. It’s not for everyone, but no game is. Some longtime fans might be upset at the new direction of the series, but I think that most would agree that it helped to not only create an amazing experience that will stay in many a gamers’ mind for a long time to come, but also in revitalizing a treasured Sony franchise. While the game does have its own self-contained story that reaches a downright beautiful ending (one of my favorites from any game ever), it also leaves enough open-ended questions to leave room for the inevitable sequel. I tried not to give too much away for the game so that you can experience most of it for yourself without having anything spoiled for you, but rest assured, it lived up to the hype for me and was easily worth my $60. I don’t want to get hopes up because I know that that can lead to disappointment, but I do recommend you buy the game and try it out without any hype. See for yourself if it lives up. All I can say is that I can’t wait to see where the series goes next, but until then, I will be happy to experience this one a second time. This may be the fourth main game in the series, but for many, it is only the beginning<br /><br />P.S: The music is AMAZING!

Yes, yes it is. What was once reserved for only select descriptions of something awe-inspiring and magnificent on an unprecedented scale is now thrown around willy-nilly for anything that is just a wee bit cool. Who’s to blame? I don’t know – I for one am part of the problem. I frequently describe the mundane as epic, when in hindsight I probably realize that there was a more appropriate word for the situation. But all that being said, God of War III is epic. No, God of War III is EPIC. I recently completed the remastered version of the game on PS4 and it is nothing short of the overused term. From start to finish, the game continues to raise a bar for how cinematic video games can be and despite being released in 2010, it still holds up incredibly well from a presentation standpoint – by that, I mean that it puts many other modern games to shame in this regard. The game has its problems, for sure, but it more than makes up for them as by the time you finish the game, you are upset that it’s all over.<br /><br /> We’ll start off with the good aspects of the game. Number one, holy crap, the game is stunning. At the very start of the game, you are thrust into battle as you ride a Titan up Mount Olympus to battle the gods. Your first foe? None other than Poseidon, the god of the sea. I shall try my best to avoid spoilers for the game, but I have to mention that the opening battle against Poseidon is one of the most breathtaking opening levels in all of gaming – God of War has always excelled with its openings, with its Hydra battle in the first game setting a golden standard and the battle against the Colossus of Rhodes in the second game cranking everything up a notch to feature an explosive battle; this game is no exception. As your Titan ally, Gaia, continues to climb, you are battling foes with all your might, performing many of the cool moves you remember from the last couple games (that L1+Square spin combo never gets old). The puny minions are nothing for you, but when the one and only Poseidon comes for you, that’s when it gets real. There’s such an exhilarating feeling throughout the fight as you use your blades to slice Poseidon’s watery form and when you finally weaken him enough, you get to take part in quite possibly the greatest boss finisher of all time. Now when I say this, I don’t mean to imply that it is super-fancy with regards to you flipping around through the air grappling him with your blades (although those finishers are cool, too), but rather that you simply walk up to the weakened god and beat the everlasting sh*t out of him.<br /><br />Some people hate quick-time events, but for me, it’s extremely satisfying to complete them when the on-screen actions are as good as they are in this fight. But it’s not just Kratos beating Poseidon; no, what really sells the fight is the camerawork. The most underappreciated aspect of the God of War series is its stunning camerawork and the way it makes everything seem so cool, no matter how great or not great it really is. As you pummel Poseidon with your bare hands, the camera shifts to the first-person view of the man you’re brutally beating. It’s an extremely simple technique, but it turns a simple QTE finisher into one of the greatest boss takedowns in video game history. And the epic choir music in the background is just fantastic, especially as you (through the eyes of Poseidon) see Kratos slowly approach you after he throws you into a rock. It’s a tremendously well-done scene that sets the tone for the entire rest of the game, with its only minor problem being that the rest of the game doesn’t quite reach this bar again. But boy, does it try!<br /><br /> So, the game has a pretty good intro with some pretty moments, but what about the gameplay? Well, it’s pretty much what you expect. The amount of added gameplay features between God of War II and III is probably equal to the amount added between the first and second games. There’s a fair number of new items and magic spells to use, including the powerful Nemean Cestus (basically giant boxing gloves), and a new item bar that automatically replenishes – useful for firing large quantities of arrows at your foes. But despite the new additions, it’s still the same core gameplay of slashing your foes with your combos and pulling off cool finishers. I don’t think it is a negative that not too much was added, especially since there’s the jump from PS2 to PS3 graphics to make it all seem fresh, but if you didn’t like the combat in the previous games, it’s hard to believe you would like it now. My only complaint is that after the intro level of the game, you once again lose all your upgrades. I understand that it’s a game and they don’t want to overpower your character right off the bat, but it’s a little annoying to have to fully upgrade Kratos’ blades again – I think that a good compromise would have been to start his blades at level three (out of five) instead of one and make the opening parts of the game a little more difficult. But that’s just me and it’s a very minor nitpick in the grand scheme of things. Overall, the combat is great and it suits the series well, especially with the boss battles.<br /><br /> I’ve already talked about the great Poseidon boss battle, but this game has many others and, just like with the previous game, almost all of them are fantastic. I’m going to spoil some of the bosses you face here, but it’s not like the story is the main focus of the game (more on that in a bit). Some of the bosses include Cronos (a giant Titan who is also the father of Zeus), Hercules (not the Disney version), and Hades (god of the underworld). Cronos is by far the most popular boss from this game and I can see why; he is essentially a level of his own, as Kratos is puny fly compared to his massive size and you spend just as much time climbing his body as you do slashing him up. Although it isn’t the most standard 1v1 fight, it is just as thrilling because of the massive size. Hercules, on the other hand, is a dude who is about twice the size of Kratos and makes for some great mano-a-mano action (and their sibling rivalry is relatively interesting, even if it’s only briefly explored). And then there’s Hades.<br /><br /> Excluding the opening boss of Poseidon, Hades is the first real boss of the game and he is, in my opinion, by far the most fun to fight. The way you kill him (which I won’t reveal) isn’t quite as cool as the opening’s beautiful cinematic standpoint and his size is definitely no Cronos, but in terms of a fun boss fight that requires you to be quick on your feet, he’s by far the best. Hades has his very own chained weapons and part of what makes the battle so great is that you are not only smashing him with your combos, but also constantly on the move so that you don’t get struck by his deadly attacks. It’s a very immersive fight that never truly lets up and I loved it because of that. While I, and many others, will always appreciate this series for its massive scale and the Cronos fight is something special to behold, I think that there’s something even more special about this fight, as it truly makes you feel like you are the one defeating him. And since it’s so early in the game, it’s not that difficult, so I got far more enjoyment out of it. I actually want to replay the fight, which leads me into the negatives of the game.<br /><br /> Going off the last point, there is no level/chapter select or boss battle mode in this game. A minor complaint? Yes, and granted, neither of these features were in the previous games either, but it would have been a nice touch for this game. The game isn’t that long (took me about 9 hours to complete), so it’s not like it’s a huge undertaking to go through it all again, but that just leads me to another complaint – the length. I am definitely a quality-over-quantity type of guy, but since this is a $30 (as of this typing) remastered version of a game that is selling for $10 on the PS3, I feel that it might not be the best deal. You could just get the God of War Saga Collection for the PS3 for $20, which includes five games total, including this one. But, seeing as how I got this game at a deal/steal of only $5, I don’t have much room to complain. I just think that it should be mentioned for those considering the purchase of this game.<br /><br /> The last thing that I want to touch upon in this review is the game’s story. Truth be told, I’m not the biggest fan of the story in these games. I find the main problem with them to be that Kratos, while cool and very much a badass, is too unlikeable and seems to blame everyone else for his problems. This game doesn’t change that. So, if you liked the previous games’ stories, you’ll probably like this one, although for my taste, it’s just more of Kratos spouting how he will have his revenge. That being said, there are some positive aspects about the story that I did like, including how the gods’ deaths were treated.<br /><br />Each time you kill a god, there are consequences, such as Poseidon’s death causing massive flooding throughout the world. I find these consequences to help the game’s story along because it seems like the developers are trying to make us realize that Kratos is doing far more harm than good here. Also, towards the end of the game, Kratos has to protect a young girl (don’t worry, no stupid escort and protect missions here). While simple and only towards the ending portion of the game, the relationship they develop is actually pretty interesting and shows Kratos’ protective parental side. I wish that the trilogy of games would have explored that aspect more, as when she is put in harm’s way, we get to see Kratos really get angry (props to Terrence C. Carson, his excellent voice actor). In addition, I feel that having this relationship would’ve made me a little more OK with how mean Kratos could be – nothing excuses cruel actions more than protecting a loved one. That seems to be what the newer game (the light reboot released in April 2018) is striving for with Kratos’ relationship with Atreus, but for just this game by itself, it was an interesting aspect of Kratos’ character that I wish was explored further.<br /><br />As for concluding the trilogy, the ending is something, to say the least. It gets a little preachy towards the end, especially for this series. I’m not quite sure what message the developers were aiming for, but I don’t think that they stuck the landing. It also seems to be a little inconsistent, narratively speaking, with past games of the series – I don’t know if I would go as far as to say there are plot holes, but it certainly overcomplicates things in what has otherwise been a series with a simple plot. But as far as cool gameplay ending sequences go, it is quite good. The final battle isn’t quite as beautifully filmed as the intro, nor as big as the Cronos fight or fun to play as the Hades fight, but it is a solid ending for the series. There’s a dreamlike sequence during this ending battle, somewhat similar to the first game’s during the battle against Ares, that was very interesting to play through. Above all else, the mashing of the circle button at the very end of the last fight is one of the most satisfying moments in recent gaming memory. While I have never been the biggest fan of the stories in these games, the finale was far from bad and from a gameplay and cinematic standpoint, it was good enough.<br /><br />God of War III is a great game. Just like the last two games, it is not perfect and I’m just not that into the story, but it more than makes up for it with the fast-paced combat and EPIC (yes, all caps are necessary) presentation. God of War III Remastered is not only a great game to sink your teeth into if you want to explore the history of the acclaimed PlayStation franchise, but also a great lesson for how to handle presentation and cinematic style in modern video games. If you can find it relatively cheap and have played the previous games, I highly recommend it. If not, buy the Saga collection for the PS3 for a much better deal. If you haven’t played the previous games, I’m not sure how much you would enjoy it, but if you’re not that interested in the story, I imagine that you would enjoy it just fine (you can always read wiki summaries online/watch some YouTube recaps). Whichever direction you choose, this game is certainly worth your time and if you decide to get it, prepare for one of the most thrilling video game experiences you’ll ever get.

Please provide the text you would like me to summarize."}, {"Rating": 5.0, "Title": "Brutal, Cinematic, and Oh-So Satisfying", "Content": "I’ve never been a huge fan of hack ‘n’ slash games. While the combat in these games usually looks cool, I find that the repetitive nature present makes me bored of them long before I finish them. Perhaps this is because the games from this genre that I have played are subpar, perhaps it is because I just don’t like the genre all that much. But God of War is a little different. Yes, it is still an action-adventure hack ‘n’ slash game, with a few puzzle elements thrown in for good measure, but its scope far exceeds these simple boundaries. Playing as Kratos, a former Spartan general, you wield the power of the gods and harness it to defeat your foes with some of the coolest, mind-blowing, and impressive-looking moves in all of gaming; keep in mind that these games are now over a decade old, with the first game coming out in 2005 (I still remember playing the demo of it on a Jampack disc – ah, the good ole days). Whether or not the impressive visual presentation in this game is enough to hold your attention is a difficult question, but let’s start with the positive aspects of the collection.<br /><br /> Firstly, you get two critically-acclaimed PS2 games in one nice, HD bundle for the price of less than one new game (I got my copy for about $10, so $5 for each game). Regardless of my opinion on these games’ quality, they are widely considered to be two of the best PS2 games of all time, and let us not forget that the PS2 had an impressive library of games during its lifespan. As to why these games are so praised, I firmly believe that it is because of the cinematic detail present in the games, but what do I mean by cinematic detail? Well, I don’t mean the graphics/textures that many gamers focus on (they’ve certainly aged, but they’re far from bad in the collection), but the actual presentation. For example, there is at least one scene in the first game where Kratos has to cross a bridge – simple enough. But as you cross the bridge, the camera pans out to show how insignificant your size is compared to the world around you and in addition to this, epic choir music kicks in to give you this enormous feeling of excitement and adventure as you continue on your quest (side note: the music in these games is godly, pun intended). The presentation makes the simplest actions seem like the most epic thing in the world. Speaking of epic, the QTEs are just that.<br /><br /> QTEs, otherwise known as quick-time events (where button prompts appear on-screen and you have to click them as actions are happening in the background), are a highly debated topic in games. Many people hate them because the player loses control, which seems bad since it is a game. Others, like myself, find that they are great for allowing a game to exceed the imposing limits of a standard control scheme, as long as they aren’t overabundant in their use. While God of War has many, many QTEs, I think that they’re use in the games is fantastic. You mainly use them for finishing off enemies in spectacular fashion, such as climbing up a cyclops to gouge their eyeball out or defeating a hydra by hooking them with your blades to pull them into a mast. These moments are what makes God of War the game series it is, for it is these over-the-top moments that allow the player to feel as if they are the most powerful warrior in existence. After playing this collection for about 20 hours (about 9 and 11 hours for each game, respectively), I never grew sick of them and as I move on to the third game, I highly doubt that my view will change. But speaking of cinematic finishers, the boss battles in the game are superb.<br /><br /> Starting with the opening level/boss of the hydra in the first game, almost every boss in the collection feels larger than life, and many of them are much larger than Kratos. The first game only features a few bosses, but each of them are memorable, with Pandora’s Guardian feature of slowly losing its armor until you see the burning flesh providing a nice visual cue for the damage it takes and Ares (the God of War) providing an interesting (albeit frustrating) swordfight and some dream-like sequences for Kratos to overcome. The second game makes these battles seem like nothing as you start off with an amazing opening level where you battle the Colossus of Rhodes and continue to fight foes such as the Dark Rider (where you must ride your own Pegasus in a sweet aerial battle), Perseus (a mano-a-mano swordfight with a man who can turn invisible), and even a Kraken. Almost all of the boss battles in the games are memorable and while most of them involve whacking away at them until the finisher icon appears, the setting, music, and finishers themselves make them extremely memorable – I doubt that I’ll ever forget the way Kratos performs his finisher against Zeus at the end of the second game. That covers the most important positive aspects of the games (but of course there are more), but I should probably mention some of the negative aspects I encountered while playing these games.<br /><br /> Firstly, the games are a little repetitive. This might just be because of my taste in games, but I find that the whole button-mashing to kill your foes gets old after a certain point. The game includes combos and different weapons and magic abilities to help spice things up, and the finishers never grow old, but I would be lying if I said I didn’t groan a little during some fights because I was getting tired of it. Many linear games suffer from this, but what usually helps this problem is an engaging story, which these games don’t have. I think that most people would agree that the second game’s story is lesser than the first, but I didn’t like the first game’s story either and there’s one crucial reason why: Kratos is too unlikeable.<br /><br />Now, I get the whole idea of a badass protagonist who couldn’t care less about what others think and is only in it for himself, but you have to have some sense of likeability with a character or else the audience loses interest in his goal. That’s not to say that you can’t have bad-natured characters – the Joker is a psychotic mass-murdering clown, but he is still an extremely likeable character. Kratos just seems to have pouts all the time when stuff doesn’t go his way. The second game features the gods turning against him because of Kratos ruthlessness getting out of control and, honestly, the gods are kind of in the right here – of course, they’re not perfect either, but Kratos just kills and kills for no reason and then gets upset when something bad happens to him because of this. But what really gets me is that they don’t just have an evil character – instead, they try to have you sympathize with him. The problem? I don’t. Sure, I certainly understand his frustration, but he brought a lot of his problems on himself and by the end of the first two games, I still didn’t care about him. At the very least, I can say that the way he deals with everything in the game (i.e., with violence) makes for some riveting gameplay. (Side Note #2: I don’t want to spoil it, but the architect subplot in the first game is really fascinating and, by far, the best part of the game, story-wise.)<br /><br /> Now, for some nitpicks. Number one, the camera in the games are usually good (again, the game’s presentation is off the charts), but there were times where I thought that it lead to deaths that could have been avoided with a better angle; you can’t control the in-game camera yourself, but that’s not a problem most of the time. Number two, the puzzles in the game are usually interesting enough to solve, but sometimes they can be frustrating because you’re at a total loss as to what to do. I don’t think that it is because they are intellectually challenging, but more so because you don’t know what is expected of you – if it was a cutscene, Kratos would just destroy everything. There was also an occasion where I had to reload my save because a glitch prevented me from progressing, but thankfully the save points and checkpoints are extremely generous in the game. Thirdly, the instant kills, whether from pitfalls or Gorgons (they turn you to stone, which means you have one hit left if you don’t break out by wiggling the analog stick quick enough), are rage-inducing (but again, the checkpoints are generous, so it’s OK most of the time). These are all just nitpicks, but problems are problems, so I wanted them to be mentioned.<br /><br />In conclusion (what a generic closing statement), the collection is most certainly worth it. Obviously, don’t get the games if you think that the amount of violence will turn you off (it most likely would), but if you want a fun hack ‘n’ slash with some of the most impressive presentation in any game (even over ten years later), it is well worth it, especially if you can get it for around $20. The game has some minor problems here and there and the story leaves a lot to be desired, but my god, these games make you feel like the most badass person in existence and the entire atmosphere is wonderful. If you think you can stomach the rage of Kratos, then be prepared for one of the most epic adventures that the PS2 had to offer and which still holds up to this day.

However, when one is not looking at the big idea of how this game changed gaming’s stance in relation to other art and just looks at the game itself, it’s amazing. Like Ico, a game made by the same team before Shadow of the Colossus, this game had a fantastic sense of atmosphere and beauty that really sucked players into the world, but unlike Ico, it also had really fun and engaging gameplay elements that made you want to keep playing. Both games were remastered for the PlayStation 3 in an HD collection, which is how I originally played them, but this newer remaster (done by the same studio who did the last one, Bluepoint Games) is rebuilt from the ground-up. Does this newer remaster do its job of presenting the game to an entire new generation of players or does it fall flat and fail miserably? For the most part, it succeeds in its goal very well.<br /><br /> When I beat this game for the first time on the PS3 a couple years ago, I actually wrote a review for it. This review for the PS4 version is more so intended for those who have already played the game, but if you want my thoughts on the game itself and not just some of the big changes, you can read those here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/review/R367AQG1M3CXHO?ref_=glimp_1rv_cl. Now, we’ll start off with the positives of the game: firstly, the game looks gorgeous – literally stunning. After the game finished installing, I booted it up and can remember being in complete awe at how amazing it looked – the game looked great on the older systems, but obviously graphics can (and do) age, but this remaster did a fantastic job of making it look better than most current games out there. Sure, the character models might not be on the same level as a Naughty Dog game, but in terms of the environment and atmosphere, very few (if any) games look as good as this game does when you are riding your horse Agro through the grassy fields with the cinematic camera – it just amazes me. Speaking of beauty, the game now also features a gallery in the main menu to look at artwork, which I don’t believe was in the previous versions of the game. While this certainly doesn’t make the game a must-buy, it’s nice that Bluepoint added this small sub-menu. Unfortunately, while beauty is important, I have to mention the negatives of this game as well, because there are some.<br /><br /> None of the negatives I mention will be deal-breakers for most people, but they really upset me because they kept the experience from being just a little bit better for me. The first problem is the controls. Now, I never played the original game on the PS2, but I know that on the PS3 version, you could remap any action to any button, so you could get whatever control scheme worked for you. The new control scheme in this game works well for the most part, especially compared to the default scheme in the PS3 version, but it doesn’t let you remap any action to any button. Sure, there are four different control schemes to choose from, but Bluepoint took a complete step backwards by not letting the players choose whatever scheme they want. The part about this that upsets me the most is Agro’s controls; many players hated how he controlled in the past versions, but I really liked his controls because I changed his accelerate button to a back button (so that I could use both analog sticks with my thumbs to steer and control the camera) – with this version, there is no control setup that allows this, meaning that it is very difficult to control him at times, at least for me. So, yeah, this will seem super nitpicky to most people, but it really annoyed me. Secondly, the physics engine (if those are the right words) still feels off – jumping with Wanderer (your character) feels really floaty and can make jumping feel very imprecise at times. I remember watching an interview with Bluepoint Games where they said that a challenge in remaking a game like this is trying to please both newcomers and longtime fans. I would guess that they kept this floaty feeling because that was in the original game, but I really wish they hadn’t. But again, those are just nitpicks and don’t detract too much from the overall experience. The only new things added to the game itself (as far as I’m aware) are gold coins littered throughout the world, but as of this writing, nobody seems to be aware of what they do. It’ll be interesting to find out over the coming days/weeks. (Also, you can save anywhere now, which is nice.)<br /><br /> That about covers the big differences of this remaster. So, is it worth it? If you’ve never played this game before, then I think it is worth it. It isn’t that long for a single playthrough (ten hours for my first playthrough on the PS3, six for my second with this version), but the experience is unlike most games, and there are incentives for replaying (trophies and time attack modes, for example). If price is an issue, then you could always wait for a price drop; I would absolutely recommend the game if it was $20 or less. Now, if you have played the game before, then the question is slightly more difficult and will really depend on personal preference (I know, that’s a cop-out answer). For me, the game was worth it simply because I had an extra $40 to spend in my budget and I just got a brand-new 4K TV that I wanted to test out, and this was the perfect opportunity. But, I’ve never been the type of person to buy a game solely for graphics, which is essentially the main reason to get this is, so keep that in mind if you’re considering buying the game.

They are notable for their classic platformer games, Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter, and their cinematic trilogy Uncharted. More recently, they were known for their masterpiece of a game, The Last of Us. While not every game they make is amazing, I honestly believe that few developers have maintained such a high level of quality in their games for as long as they have. It is also very interesting to see how their games’ maturity levels have evolved. With Crash and the first Jak game, they were kid-friendly games meant for all ages, but the later Jak games and Uncharted were for more a teen/young adult audience (although almost any age can enjoy them). With The Last of Us, Naughty Dog released their first truly dark game and it is arguably their most popular game yet, both critically and commercially. With Uncharted 4, Naughty Dog has crafted one of the most beautiful, touching, and fun games I have ever had the pleasure of playing.<br /><br /> Obviously, I’m a pretty big fan of Naughty Dog, but I think that in order to understand where I’m coming from with this review, I should mention what I think about their previous games, specifically the Uncharted series. When I first played Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune, I thought (and still think) it was a solid third-person shooter with gorgeous (at the time) visuals and fun characters. Uncharted 2, however, was on a completely different level and is still, 8 years after its release, one of the best games I have ever played. The characters were written better, the visuals were even more impressive, the set pieces were huge, and the pacing was phenomenal, meaning you were almost never bored when playing. While Uncharted 3 didn’t have that same leap as from the first to second game, it was still a great game in my eyes and probably my second favorite of the trilogy, even if the pacing was a little off in the first half of the game. So, with that out of the way, let’s get on to the meat of the review, starting with the gameplay.<br /><br /> Despite what I’ve heard from many people, mostly those who haven’t played the games, the Uncharted series has always had changes to its gameplay with each entry. Not all of them are great or noticeable at first, but when you play the games back-to-back, you begin to appreciate the subtleties a lot more. With this game, one of the biggest additions to the game is the rope. By simply holding the L1 button, Nathan will start swinging his rope around and if there are any spots to grapple, releasing the button will allow him to hook onto it. It is a very simple and intuitive mechanic, allowing for not only Tarzan-like movements, but also some very cool takedowns on enemies; try getting into a gunfight, running away, jumping off of a ledge, grappling midair, and then jumping again off of the rope to land a fist in your enemies face. Moments like those are what make the rope so satisfying and it was one of the best additions to the gameplay.<br /><br /> Speaking of taking out your enemies, the melee system is also the best in the entire series, taking the best parts from Uncharted 3 and removing the worst. For example, one of my favorite additions to the third game’s combat was having Nathan automatically take an enemy’s weapon from them if you had none, which returns here. On the other hand, my least favorite addition was the grab move, as it made combat needlessly frustrating since rolling and grabbing were the same button (leading to way too many deaths for this player). So, what did they do? They removed the ability to grab, which is fine by me. Usually, going in for a melee kill will require you to just mash the square button, but every once in a while, you’ll have to perform a counter move with the triangle button, which is very easy to do, but it is cool to see the different animations during the game, especially when they are Naughty Dog quality. In addition to the combat being improved, the gunplay has also been changed for the better.<br /><br /> The best part, hands down, is the ability to pick up ammo with the triangle button and the ability to pick up weapons by holding down the same button. This means that you can walk across the battlefield while tapping triangle and not have to worry about accidentally picking up a gun you don’t like, like in previous games. I don’t see why you can’t just automatically pick up ammo, but it is still a welcome change. This is especially helpful because this game’s combat has a lot more emphasis on mobility. With the previous Uncharted games, you usually just wanted to stay in cover and shoot your enemies, but with this game, almost all cover is destructible and since you can’t throw back grenades (which doesn’t hurt the gameplay at all), you always need to be moving. With the quick melee kills and fun rope swinging, this new approach to combat works very well and makes for some of the most enjoyable fights in the entire series. But, I think my favorite part of the combat would have to be the greater emphasis on stealth.<br /><br /> Make no mistake, the stealth in this game is no Metal Gear Solid or Splinter Cell, but it is fun and satisfying nonetheless. Like the previous games, you can automatically sneak around when you reach a new area and you can silently take out enemies using the square button, usually by pulling them off of ledges or sneaking behind them. This works just as well as it did before, but there are few new features that make it more satisfying. First, there are now locations for you to hide in, which is usually just tall grass or foilage. This works perfectly because you can still move around in it and they are conveniently located around, so it makes sneaking about much easier. Second, you can now mark enemies by aiming at them and clicking a button; doing this will put a small arrow above their head that will let you always know their location, which is not only very useful in stealth scenarios, but also in combat when you are trying to figure out how to flank enemies. Finally, your partners can help you by sometimes taking out enemies that are in the way – granted, this doesn’t happen often, but I did notice it. Like The Last of Us, your allies can’t be detected and although this might break the immersion for some players, I prefer this over the alternate methods of not having backup or having them able to get caught. Overall, I’m very pleased with the combat improvements in the game, but the game also has more exploration to it.<br /><br /> Although the series is called Uncharted, implying that you are exploring uncharted areas, the series is known for being extremely linear, but I’ve never had a problem with that in the series, as I think it helps the games maintain their high-quality. That being said, this game is a lot more open-ended. Instead of having levels featuring only one way to proceed, there are sometimes two or three ways of climbing somewhere, especially towards the latter half of the game. Again, the game is still linear, but compared to the other games, this game does have a different way of designing levels. Two of the 22 chapters actually feature levels that you can explore for quite a long time without progressing at all – one of these with a jeep in Madagascar and the other is with a boat out in the ocean. While I have always loved the linear levels, I think that these couple levels are a nice change of pace. As long as they don’t take over the entire game, which they don’t, I’m OK with these. The only problem I have with these areas are the lack of good rewards for exploring – you usually only receive the silly treasures that have been a trademark in the series, but sometimes you get a better reward, which brings me to discussing the collectibles in the game.<br /><br /> As I just mentioned, the treasures from previous games return, and they are as annoying as ever. Unlike Uncharted 3, they do give you points for collecting them (used to buy post-game rewards such as skins, weapons, render modes, and modifiers), so they can be useful, but they are just so boring to look for and collect, which is why I just use a guide for my second playthrough and never bother with them again. However, the game yet again takes inspiration from The Last of Us in providing artifacts to collect, this time being called journal entries; these pages provide some interesting backstory on the game’s events and make exploring worth it. I usually had fun exploring regardless of the rewards, but I enjoyed collecting the journal notes and entries far more than collecting the almost-meaningless treasures. Unfortunately, there are about twice as many treasures as there are journal entries and notes, so you won’t always be receiving an intriguing note. There are also optional conversations – again, these are just like they were in The Last of Us, and I enjoy hearing these little side talks the characters have. These new types of collectibles are what makes this game achieve a 15-hour length, but I don’t think that it is just padding; I enjoy exploring and learning about characters and their world, so it is time well spent.<br /><br /> Before I dive into the story, I just want to quickly mention that in some pre-release footage, the game showed that you could make choices in the game during select conversations. These only appear three times in the story and are completely pointless, changing the story in no way and only affecting those three select lines in the game. I’m guessing that Naughty Dog included these as a sort of test for themselves to see if they would ever be able to make a game with branching storylines, but it doesn’t affect the game in any negative way here, so there’s nothing to worry about. Just pick the lines you think are the best and move on with the game. Now, on to the story!<br /><br /> One of the most notable aspects of this game’s story is that it is much darker and realistic than previous entries – the main menu starts with ambient noise and a video of a dead pirate in a cage, which is quite different from the triumphant menus of the previous games. Obviously, the game is still very unrealistic with its set pieces and Nate being a God at fighting an army, but it terms of characterization, this is different than the original games. Don’t misunderstand me, the characters are still the same people we’ve grown to love, but there is something less fictional about them. I attribute this difference to the change of writers; Amy Hennig was the creative director/head writer for the previous games, while Neil Druckmann was the creative director/head writer for The Last of Us and this game. Different people have different tastes and although I love Hennig’s superb writing in the previous games, I honestly prefer Druckmann’s writing in these past two games. Having characters with more emotion and more realistic interactions makes me feel more emotionally involved with them. The game also has a slower pace, which allows for more character development. One of my favorite scenes has Nate sit down with his brother, Sam, and just talk. This conversation is completely optional, but it adds so much to both of their characters and something like that would’ve never happened with Hennig as a writer. I’m not trying to criticize her, as she is still one of my favorite writers, but I do prefer Druckmann.<br /><br /> I did mention that the game is slower paced and for the most part, this works in the game’s favor. The beginning chapters are particularly slow, but I think chapter four more than makes up for it – it is just a short chapter that shows what a normal life is for Nate and Elena, and it is this exact realism that allows for some of the best dialogue in the entire series. However, there were a couple times throughout the game where the slow pacing worked against the game, most notably during the two Scotland chapters. These areas weren’t bad chapters, but after being roughly one-third of the way through the game, it was just getting to be a little much. Thankfully, I think the pacing gets back on track once you get out of there. As I’ve mentioned before, the pacing is still slower than the previous games, but the greater emphasis on the story and characters make it worth it in my opinion.<br /><br /> So, now I’m just going to mention a few tidbits about the story that I like, but I don’t want to go into too much detail because I don’t want to spoil anything. First, I mentioned that the journal entries allow for some great backstory to be inserted into the game, and I know this has been said in many other reviews, but it is amazing at how Uncharted 4 not only has a great main narrative, but also a great subplot with Henry Avery and the pirates. You don’t need to collect journal entries to understand it, as it is addressed in the main game, but collecting it adds so much more depth and makes you feel like you, not Nathan Drake, are actually uncovering history - I love it. Second, Rafe Adler is, by far, the best villain in the series – you love to hate him. He can be charismatic and suave one minute, but the next minute, he is flipping out on you and going into a psychotic rant. Most of the villains in the series were clichés; well clichés with fun performances, but clichés nonetheless. While Rafe does have some tropes, such as being a spoiled rich boy, the game makes him remarkably three-dimensional and he is just one of the best written characters in the series – he steals every scene he is in and for my first playthrough, I was always one the edge of my seat when he appeared, wondering what he would do next. The only thing that I will say about the story is that, just like the other games, there are probably some plot holes or inconsistencies, but if you don’t overthink it, you’ll still be sucked in and love it.<br /><br /> The last thing that I want to mention about the story is the ending. I won’t spoil it, but I will mention that when I first beat the game, I was very conflicted on how I felt about it. However, after beating the ending a second time, I realized how much I appreciated the way Naughty Dog ended the series – it was a really fitting end for the series. So, even if you don’t appreciate it your first time through, you will most likely grow to like it as time passes by.<br /><br /> Another quick tidbit that I want to mention is the music. My God, the music! A lot of people were worried when Greg Edmonson, the composer for the original trilogy, wasn’t returning for this game, but I can safely say that Henry Jackman fills his shoes nicely. I won’t say that he is better, because music is probably the most subjective art form, but I definitely loved his score in this game and found him to be a suitable replacement. Again, this is probably just me, but I’m confident that most people would like this score. The tracks For Better or Worse (played in chapter 17, which has the same name) and The Twelve Towers (played during many combat encounters in the game) are particularly noteworthy. Bravo, Mr. Jackman, bravo!<br /><br /> Before I conclude, I must again mention something that I think is very important: chapters 17 through 20 and the final chapter (22) are some of the best batch of levels in any game I’ve ever played. Without spoiling anything, I’m just going to say that chapter 17 has the best character interactions in the series and it rivals what was done in The Last of Us (which is “kind of a big deal”); chapter 18 has the best scene in the series and one of the best in gaming in general (this scene involves a dining table and you’ll probably know it when you see it); chapter 19 has the best creepy atmosphere since the Spaniard levels in the original game; and chapter 20 has probably the best gunfights in the series. These are all amazing feats and the game ends with the best boss battle in the series (not that that is saying much, but it is fun). Because Uncharted is so focused on story and characters, it is very difficult to describe why these parts of the game are so great, but if you’ve ever wanted a story that has the realistic writing of The Last of Us with the gameplay of Uncharted, this game is it. If you’ve played the three main games, you owe it to yourself to finish the series off with the best game in the series – I put it on equal grounds with the second game (Uncharted 2 has better pacing, but this game has a better story to make up for it). So, go buy this masterpiece right now and, as the great Victor Sullivan would say, “have a helluva time.”", "ParentASIN": "B014R4KYMS", "Timestamp": 1501515507851, "ItemName": "Uncharted 4: A Thief's End - PlayStation 4", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.7, "RatingCount": 5121, "Price": 24.99, "Categories": ["Video Games", "PlayStation 4", "Games"], "Description": "Retired fortune hunter Nathan Drake is drawn back into the world of thieves years after his last adventure.

While the series wasn’t as popular during the PS3 era, it was still very successful and had many wonderful games released for the system, mainly the excellent Future games. With this new game, Insomniac Games (the developers/creators of the series) decided to try a weird, albeit successful, approach; they didn’t reboot the series per se, or just do a flat-out movie tie-in game, but rather a combination of both, with a few new things added. With all of this together, they created what has been called a “reimagining” of the original 2002 game. That is probably the best way to describe the game and despite some reservations before playing it, I’m very glad I finally got around to completing it, as it was pretty d*mn fun!<br /><br /> Here’s a quick summarization of the gameplay of the series if you’ve never played any: this is both a platformer and third-person shooter game. While I’m sure there have been other games like this, Ratchet and Clank has always been, to the best of my knowledge, the most popular series that combined these two elements together. You travel to various locations (usually planets, sometimes areas in space) and collect gadgets, weapons, and other items to help further progress whatever the story happens to be (and side missions for additional items, of course). The first game was mostly a platformer with shooter elements, but future games turned that around and made it more of a shooter-platformer hybrid series, making for a lot of fun. The game also encourages you to try out different weapons by having a simple leveling system; the more you use a weapon in the game, the more experience it gains, which causes it to level up and gain more attributes (there is also a new game plus mode in each game, which also adds replay value for those wanting to get everything collected and maxed out in the game). The premise of the series’ gameplay is very simple, but that is part of the reason it appeals to all ages in my opinion. So, with that out of the way, I’ll go into more detail about what I specifically didn’t like and did like about this specific game.<br /><br /> I’ll start with the negatives, which might seem nitpicky, but I feel like they are legitimate complaints. First, while Insomniac pointed out multiple times that this wasn’t a straight reboot or remake of the series, I think it could’ve been better if it was. Because this isn’t a reboot, most of the levels feel very similar since they aren’t much different from the original game; this can make the game lose some of that “new” feeling, but if you never played the original, you probably don’t care. The opposite applies because this game isn’t a remake; while most of the levels are very similar, the differences can really bug players who were expecting more of the original game – I think only eleven out of the original eighteen planets appeared in this game (although they added one new area and redesigned some of the other planets to make them longer). This whole reimagining aspect doesn’t make the game bad, but I would’ve rather had a straight-up remake or reboot, or even a sequel. But, again, if you’ve never played the original, this paragraph probably doesn’t affect you at all, so on to the next one.<br /><br /> The other two parts of the gameplay that didn’t appeal to me are also fairly small complaints, but complaints nonetheless. During the game, you’ll occasionally play as Clank, usually completing puzzles. This has always been part of the franchise, but I believe these are probably the worst Clank segments in the series because they are just plain boring – picking up gadgetbots and changing them into different forms to help solve puzzles didn’t end up being very fun. The original trilogy’s puzzles weren’t very intricate, but they were fun distractions from the main game, while one of the newer entries, A Crack in Time (2009), had what are arguably the best puzzles of the entire series. To be fair, A Crack in Time involved time manipulation in its gameplay, allowing for better puzzles, but going from those amazing puzzles to these subpar ones isn’t exactly a step forward. The last part about the game that irked me is the weapon leveling system. Since the second game in the series, you’ve been able to level your weapons by using them, which is a great idea that I loved for the first few games I completed, but after beating eight or so games in the series, I’m sick of it. I like the idea, but the game essentially forces you to use weapons you don’t like to level them up. Now, if you don’t care about completing everything in the game, I suppose you could just ignore those weapons, but I like having all my guns fully upgraded and this can get annoying; Ratchet and Clank is a platformer-shooter, so why should I have to stop and snipe enemies with a fairly weak sniper just so I can upgrade it? I wish you would get experience from enemies and you could choose what weapons earn the experience. You would still have to switch weapons around during the game to conserve ammo and to defeat tougher enemies (the blaster at the beginning of the game gets weak early on), so I don’t see why not. But I digress, now let’s get on to what I did like about the gameplay.<br /><br />  The actual combat is awesome. I’ve been informed that the game only runs at 30fps (unlike some of the earlier games), but it feels smoother than ever in my opinion. The combat is essentially me just holding L2 to aim/strafe, R2 to fire, and pressing X every once in a while to evade enemy fire with fancy jumps. While this combat isn’t new to the series, the wonderful graphics and smooth animation makes it feel amazing. I’ve never paid much attention to whether or not a game is 30 or 60fps, but rest assured, the 30fps doesn’t negatively impact this game. The other aspect that I really liked was the flying, which was introduced in the last main game for the PS3, Into the Nexus (2013). While that game is one of my least favorite in the series (mainly because of the short length), my favorite addition to that game was the flying, which is basically the same here, except prettier. After getting a certain upgrade for Clank, Ratchet can get fuel at certain points in the game, allowing him to fly within that area of the game – one level lets you fly all over the level once you get the upgrade. The idea of flying around with several guns at your disposal and annihilating your foes from above is every bit as cool as it sounds, especially when it is a tougher enemy or boss, making it an awesome aerial battle. My only quibble about the flying is that you don’t get a lot of fuel, meaning you are constantly going back to refuel during a fight, but the experience is still great. The next part that I want to cover is the collectibles, which I think are probably the best out of the entire series.<br /><br /> Like most games in the series, this game has the optional side collectible of Gold Bolts, which have unlocked different rewards in the different games. The first game allowed you to buy more powerful versions of weapons you already own with these bolts, while the second game allowed you to buy weapon modifications. Unfortunately, later games only allowed you to buy skins for Ratchet, which usually looked mediocre and made collecting them feel pointless (although the previous game went back to the original game’s method). In this game, however, the rewards are a lot more diverse, with new skins for both Ratchet and his ship, different types of bolts to collect (changing them into coins, rings, etc.), concept art, the ability to adjust the speed of your game, and more. Usually, these rewards were unlocked by completing Skill Points (which aren’t in this game), but I definitely prefer them as Gold Bolt rewards; they aren’t a pain to collect and make it worthwhile this time, which brings me to the Holocards.<br /><br />  The other main collectible in the game is the Holocard, which are my favorite collectible in the entire series because you don’t have to focus on collecting them. You can find packs of holocards in the game by either exploring or defeating enemies (who randomly drop them) and the reason I like this is because I don’t have to worry whether or not I collected every pack on every planet – the cards in said packs are completely random, so I just naturally get some. And because they are random (except for the RYNO cards, which are in set spots because they unlock a specific weapon), for every five duplicate cards you get, you can trade them in for a new one, meaning you should never worry about that one card you can’t randomly get (since there are about 100 of these). Also, you can actually read info on each of these cards, many of which contain information about previous games in the series. Best of all, each set of cards (three cards per set) has a reward tied to it, such as a five percent increase in bolts or the upgraded form of a weapon being available to buy in Challenge Mode (aka, New Game Plus). These cards are just so satisfying to get and require virtually no frustration, so I was very pleased with this addition and hope it is in future games.<br /><br />  Overall, the gameplay is very well done and the main reason to buy the game, despite my complaints. It isn’t perfect, but it is so much fun and very addicting. I think that this series is starting to become like The Legend of Zelda in that each game has a very similar formula (in this case, get very similar gadgets and weapons in each game and travel to planets similar to those from past games), but because there are several small additions to each, it doesn’t feel repetitive. Obviously, having a formula isn’t for everyone, especially if you want a completely new experience every time, but it seemingly works for Zelda and in my ever so humble opinion, it does for this game, too. That pretty much covers the gameplay aspects, so now I’ll cover the story, which was never the main draw of a Ratchet and Clank game, but still worth discussing.<br /><br /> Captain Copernicus Leslie Qwark narrates this game. If you haven’t played much of the series, that means nothing to you, but Qwark is probably the funniest character in the entire series and although his narration isn’t a huge focus, it is still wonderful to hear his voice pop up every now and then not only during cut scenes, but also during gameplay. One of my favorite lines occurred when I was swimming underwater for a long time and my oxygen was running low, prompting his narration to say something along the lines of “No matter how hard he tried, Ratchet could still not breath underwater.” My boring semi-quote doesn’t do the line nearly as much justice as it should, but Jim Ward (Qwark’s voice actor) has owned this role for over a decade and bless him, as he is absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately, Ratchet and Clank’s characters aren’t nearly as good.<br /><br /> On the bright side, their voice actors still do a fine job, but their characterization is vastly inferior to the original versions. In the original game, Ratchet starts off rather cocky and later vengeful after he gets betrayed, while Clank is a little slow to catch on and simply wants to complete his mission; by the end of the game, however, they are able to develop a close, and more importantly, believable friendship that lasts throughout the entire series. With this game, they not only barely talk to each other (this game could’ve just been called Ratchet), but Ratchet is a stereotypical goody-two shoes at the beginning who simply wants to be a hero. There is very little characterization going on and to be quite frank, it ruined the story for me. For example, in the original game, Clank gets a helipack upgrade that makes him look a little goofy, which causes Ratchet to chuckle, but in this game, he says that he does indeed look cool. A small detail? Absolutely, but I don’t like these bland versions of the characters I’ve loved for years. At least Qwark goes through some character arc throughout the game – it isn’t as good as his arc throughout the original trilogy, mind you, but it is still good. Finally, the plot itself is very messy.<br /><br /> There were a few times throughout the game where something would happen and then a few seconds later, we would cut to a completely different scene and I felt like I was missing something that should’ve been explained. This is probably because the game is also a movie tie-in, so they couldn’t explain everything, but from what I’ve heard (since I haven’t seen the movie), the movie suffers from this, too. My guess is that the film is probably missing parts that the game covers (i.e., levels) and the game is missing parts that the film covers (i.e., scenes), so to get the full experience, you’d have to see both, which is poor storytelling in my eyes. Also, Dr. Nefarious is in this game, but I don’t think he should’ve been. Granted, he is my favorite villain in the series (and part of the reason why I love Up Your Arsenal and A Crack in Time so much), but there was no reason for him to be in this reimagining – Drek was a fine villain for the original game. Speaking of Drek, he has a different voice actor and while I like this version of Drek, he is also a completely different character than he was in the original. If this were a complete reboot, I would probably be more lenient, but I think they should’ve just made a new character instead of completely changing an old one (but again, I do still like this Drek). I think that this game had one of the weakest stories in the series, which is a shame because even though they were never the best parts of the game, they were always entertaining. You win some, you lose some, I suppose.<br /><br /> Before I conclude my review, I just want to mention that this game doesn’t include manual saving. The game autosaves frequently, but I still don’t see why this option wasn’t included. It has been in the series since it began and I see no reason why it had to be removed (this removal began in the last game, but it was a silly decision there, too). So, if you are ever unsure if the game saved the last thing you did, just travel to a different planet to be sure, because it autosaves every time you do that. On to the conclusion!<br /><br /> So, what do I think of this game? I think that despite some gameplay quirks and a weak story, it is still very fun, hence why it gets four stars. It’s not revolutionary or the best in the series (*cough* Up Your Arsenal *cough*), but like almost all the games in the franchise, it is too fun to pass up. If you count every Ratchet and Clank game together and include all new games and Challenge Modes, I’ve beaten them a total of 18+ times and I’m still not sick of the series. Hopefully, the next game improves on the minor complaints I had, but as this game stands right now, it is very entertaining and I highly recommend it if you want a fun, ten-hour game (plus Challenge Mode). As per the tagline for the original game and my review of said game, buy it and go blow some sh*t up.", "ParentASIN": "B00Z9LUDX4", "Timestamp": 1500997083854, "ItemName": "Ratchet & Clank - PlayStation 4", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.6, "RatingCount": 2789, "Price": null, "Categories": ["Video Games", "PlayStation 4", "Games"], "Description": "A new Ratchet & Clank game, inspired by the movie and the 2002 PS2 game, features an expanded origin story with over an hour of cinematics, enhanced visuals for PS4, a vast arsenal of weapons, new planets, updated gameplay, flight sequences, Clank gameplay, and new boss battles."}, {"Rating": 5.0, "Title": "Kifflom: My Top Ten Favorite GTA V Missions", "Content": "SPOILERS!<br /><br />Grand Theft Auto is one of the definitive, if not the definitive, open-world/sandbox game series. The game is notable for the freedom that it allows the player, from minor activities such as playing golf to major activities such as evading not only the cops, but also the military in high-speed chases. Despite this level of freedom in the game, the series is also notable for having a very enjoyable main storyline, because of both the fun gameplay and characters. While I have played various parts of various GTA games (mostly Liberty City Stories and San Andreas), the only game that I’ve completed (and put over 120 hours into, no less) is the latest game, GTA V. Some people prefer other games in the series, but even with that comparison, it is a great game. Aside from having a sh*t ton of stuff to do, there is the engaging storyline, which I absolutely love. I think that because the game didn’t take itself as seriously as other games in the series, I could enjoy it more, especially with Trevor’s character. The gameplay mechanics, especially the combat (mainly shooting and getting into cover) were also vastly improved from the previous installments. So, without further ado, here is my personal list of my favorite GTA V missions.<br />NOTE: I’m excluding Strangers and Freaks’ missions, so don’t expect any Grass Roots or Rampage missions here (although both of those mission types are awesome nonetheless).<br /><br />#10: The Multi-Target Assassination<br />The reason that I love this mission so much is because of how quick it is and how it makes you feel very tense, like how even the smallest mistake could ruin it all. This mission is the second Lester Assassination mission, where you must snipe four different targets, all within a time limit. There’s just something great about driving my motorcycle, getting off, sniping the target, and then quickly traveling to the next one. The time limit is also very lenient, so while it did make me feel tense, it wasn’t frustrating. This is a very simple mission, especially with regards to characterization, but it was so fun.<br /><br />#9: The Wrap Up<br />The opening alone made this worth a mention on this list, as it involves several people pulling guns on each other in a hilarious scene; you have Michael and Davey on one team, Agent Haines by himself, Haines’ partner (Agent Sanchez, who turned out to be a double agent) working with the FIB, the IAA, and even Merryweather. Haines ends up escaping on his own, but Davey and Michael are being quickly overwhelmed, so who swoops in with his sniper to save the day? Trevor! This is awesome because one, Michael and him were not on good terms, so it is cool to see him save the day (predictable, maybe, but still cool); and two, who doesn’t love switching back-and-forth between Michael, who is on the ground taking enemies head on, and Trevor, who is providing cover fire for Michael? Plus, sniping helicopter pilots is always fun, so this mission is a keeper for me.<br /><br />#8: Lamar Down<br />This mission is great for two simple reasons: firstly, Lamar is a hilarious character – his wannabe gangster attitude is a perfect foil for Franklin’s logical reasoning- and secondly, you also get to multiple ways to confront the situation, just like the last mission. The difference, however, is that you now get two men on the ground (Franklin and Trevor), and get to snipe as Michael. This works out well because Michael’s special ability makes sniping a breeze and Trevor’s rage mode makes gunning down enemies a blast. While Franklin doesn’t have any on-foot special abilities, his determination to save his friend makes this mission, especially towards the end when he is driving him home, have some great character interaction. This is the first of three missions I’ve included that involve all three characters as part of the gameplay, and those are always amazing missions in my book.<br /><br />#7: Fresh Meat<br />During the ending of the amazing Bury the Hatchet mission, Michael is captured by Trevor’s competitors, falsely believing that he is his lover and will come to save him. Since Trevor and Michael aren’t on speaking terms, it is up to Franklin and Lester to save the day. Lester helps Franklin find where they are keeping him and thus begins a shootout to save Michael. Most of my favorite missions involve simple shootouts, but I love the simplicity of GTA’s combat; you slide in cover, you pop out every now and then to clip down some guys, and then you move on to the next area. Once you reach Michael, you can freely swap between them and take out your enemies while trying to escape. I think this mission, along with Lamar Down, helps to solidify his status as a trusting and loyal member of the team (which Trevor would be, too, if he wasn’t a psychopath), which I liked (and why I hated the two alternate endings in the game). A simple shootout with two characters is why this mission is great in my eyes.<br /><br />#6: Blitz Play<br />Blitz Play is just a full-on assault mission where you have Franklin and Michael in cover, shooting officers as you wait for your opening to escape, while Trevor is perched up high with his RPG and sniper, providing cover. Again, the premise is very simple, but I love switching between all the characters. If I want to try to get as many headshots as possible, Michael is my guy, but when I want to blow up cars to help eliminate large groups of enemy, I’m going to Trevor. Franklin doesn’t have a special ability or position, but it is still cool to have a third character to switch to in this firefight. There’s only one more mission with all three characters left and this mission was already fantastic, and it only gets better.<br /><br />#5: Meltdown<br />At this point in the story, life seems to be going alright for Michael – he helped make his first movie, he is planning his biggest score, and he has his family back in his life. Unfortunately, Devin Weston is still upset because Michael didn’t listen to him and not only scared Molly into accidentally killing herself, but also prevented him from potentially making billions from a business deal. Because of this, he sends people to kill Michael’s family, meaning Jimmy and him must race back home, save his girls (wife and daughter), and take down the gunmen. Once again, this mission is mainly just a simple shootout, but the idea of Michael being in a tuxedo with his own pistol reminds me of 007 and him doing this not as a heist to gain money, but to save his family adds a sense of urgency that I appreciated; this game’s story is mainly played for laughs, but a dose of seriousness every now and then is nice, which is why I liked this mission a lot.<br /><br />#4: The Jewel Store Job<br />The first heist is one to remember and my personal second favorite of the bunch. While the Merryweather heist has a cool stealth element ending with a bang and the Bureau Raid is cool because you parachute into a highly defended federal building (if you did the roof option), this mission is great because, just like the shootouts, it is simple. You stake the place out, you analyze your options, you get the necessary supplies, and you rob a jewel store. There is very little in this game as satisfying as completing your first heist and seeing those bank accounts reach six digits, possibly seven for Michael. Plus, even though Trevor’s first mission didn’t make it to the list, it is the first mission after this and that was a great introduction for him.<br /><br />#3: Bury the Hatchet:<br />Let’s ignore the graveyard shootout that is the focus of the latter half of this mission, as I’ve already established that I love the combat in this game. No, what makes this mission for me is the character dynamic between Trevor and Michael. Michael, sitting at home being his depressed self, sees Trevor walk in. Although they aren’t on the best terms at this point in the story, they seem to be bonding. However, this eventually turns sour and Trevor leaves in disgust, after finally starting to realize what happened in North Yankton and to Brad. Throughout the entire game, Trevor and Michael have this difficult relationship and this is, in my opinion, the climax of it – it all goes down here. What is also a nice bonus is when you are driving to the graveyard as Michael, you hear a voiceover of Michael’s past self explaining to Amanda why he must betray his friends. Just like Meltdown, this mission offers a small dose of seriousness to the otherwise silly story and just like that mission, I love it.<br /><br />#2: Monkey Business<br />This mission is the definition of cool in my book. Michael, along with Agent Haines and Davey, must infiltrate the IAA to retrieve a nerve toxin and then try to escape without being killed. Easy, right? Multiple components come together to make this mission one of the best in the game: firstly, diving underwater with your scuba suit, slicing your way inside the base, and sneaking around with your mask once again evokes the 007 aura of Michael; secondly, you have a stun gun to zap people and later in the mission, you go full-out with your pistol (or at least, that’s what I was using); thirdly, the first-person mode on the enhanced version makes this mission infinitely cooler. I’m not a huge fan of Call of Duty, but this mission reminded me of some of the better missions in the Modern Warfare trilogy, but with the GTA style – personally, I recommend using first-person mode while having the settings changed to automatically switch to third-person when you are in cover (this lets you experience the first-person perspective while still being able to easily take down enemies in cover). And to top it all off, the mission ends with Trevor returning Patricia to her husband, all while Chicago’s hit song, If You Leave Me Now, plays on the radio. The ending is both the saddest and funniest part of the entire game and that, along with the amazing infiltration aspect of the rest of the mission, is why it is my second favorite mission in the game.<br /><br />#1: The Paleto Score<br />The last mission was the definition of cool, but this mission is the definition of awesome. Sure, The Big Score was also a great mission and provided a large monetary reward, but there is almost nothing cooler in this game than Trevor wearing a juggernaut suit and mowing down (corrupt) police officers with a minigun. The mission isn’t very hard (or at least, it wasn’t for me since I selected Chef as my crew member), but it is the epitome of fun in this series. For the first part of this heist, I chose Trevor for his minigun and rage ability, then the game switches you over to Franklin to use a bulldozer (where his slow motion driving greatly helps), and for the ending part, I used Michael because we were heading inside and his slow motion shooting ability is very helpful for headshots. This mission utilized all the characters, even the crew member, very well, with all their abilities suiting their part in the mission. The intro, where you simply drive to the bank, is also hysterical because each member discusses their first score, effectively making all the members bond. This mission has it all: humor, guns, explosions, great character interactions, and above all else, it is fun. Those are the reasons that this is my favorite mission in the entire game.<br /><br />Thank you for reading and if you don’t have the game, go buy it now (unless you hate games and/or are easily offended)", "ParentASIN": "B0086VPUHI", "Timestamp": 1498698250941, "ItemName": "Grand Theft Auto V: Premium Edition - Xbox One [Digital Code]", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.6, "RatingCount": 858, "Price": 15.0, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Xbox One", "Games"], "Description": "In a city where trust is scarce, a young hustler, a retired bank robber, and a psychopath must execute dangerous heists to survive.

The Assassin’s Creed games are cool (usually). The Arkham games are cool. What do you get when you combine them all together? You get a cool game. OK, so that doesn’t describe what the game is about, but when you ignore all the fluff that the game has and look at it for what it really is, that is exactly what you get, for better or worse. The open-world design of the game and movement of the main character is just like the Assassin games, the combat system is just like the Arkham games (including the same button combinations for special moves), and the story is set during the years between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. On the surface, this seems like an amazing combination and for the most part, it works rather well, but the game not only comes with the benefits of being inspired by those games, but also the flaws of them. To start, let’s discuss the Assassin-inspired aspects of the game.<br /><br /> One of the earliest objectives you can complete in the game is climb a very tall tower, scan the surrounding area (to help complete your map), and perform a (at first) cool leap off said tower. Like many open-world games since Assassin’s Creed rise to fame, this is just like the viewpoints in those games and they are just as annoying and addicting (although I loved being able to fast travel to previous towers from the get-go, so that was a nice touch). My personal gripe with these open-world games is that the side missions are usually not very fun to complete, but they are so addicting that you feel as if it is your duty to complete them. Aside from climbing towers, you can also rescue slaves from the Orcs and Uruks, which is extremely repetitive and boils down to killing several enemies in one area before walking up to the slaves to free them. There are also collectibles to pick up, such as artifacts, which are annoying to collect, but add some interesting lore (more on that later), and challenges to complete. The challenges were one of my favorite aspects of the game as they were very to the point, so to speak. For example, if I went to start a sword challenge, I knew that my basic objective was to kill multiple enemies (usually with large combos), which is fun, but if I went to a bow challenge, then I knew I would have to mainly use that; the third type of challenge would involve the dagger in stealth scenarios. As a side note, you can perform stealth executions even a few seconds after a guard discovers you, which is one of the best parts about this game. It is so annoying in other games when one guard discovers you and you are automatically in an alert mode; this game allows you to still instantly kill that guard with a stealth kill, saving me much frustration throughout the game. Most of those challenges were very fun and although the other objectives weren’t especially enjoyable, they were addicting and I found myself playing the game for hours longer than intended because of them. That being said, I became bored with the game by the 15-hour mark (roughly 60% completion) and I was ready to move on to a different game. So, that part of the game is OK – not great, but not awful. This brings us to the next piece of the puzzle: the Arkham combat.<br /><br /> I, being a huge Batman fan who likes to play games, love the Arkham games. I think that they are not just the best Batman, superhero, and licensed games, but also some of the best games of all time (in my ever so humble opinion). One of the big reasons for that is the great combat system, which is easy to learn, but difficult to master. Shadow of Mordor uses almost exactly the same combat, where you attack with square, counter with triangle, stun with circle, and leap with the cross button. After attaining upgrades, you can perform special moves when your hit streak is high enough, such as brutally finishing off enemies (usually with a decapitation). As a fan of this combat, I loved its inclusion in this game and it is the main reason the sword challenges were some of my favorite parts of the game. However, since the combat is directly influenced by the Arkham games, it is hard to not unfavorably compare it. First of all, the special moves are finnicky and don’t always work (sometimes performing a stun instead of an execution) – this happened in the Arkham games every now and then, but not nearly as much. Also, while I would still say the combat is smooth, it isn’t quite as smooth as the other games; I found it very difficult to perform critical strikes in this game, which come to me very naturally in Arkham. These are very minor nitpicks, but they did bug me throughout the game. Still, they added a couple improvements, which I wish were in Arkham Knight. You can counter enemies when performing a ground execution (only fans of the Arkham games will know the pain this would relieve) and you automatically stun enemies, leaving them wide open for an attack, when you leap over them. These couple improvements help to balance the negatives out for me, so as a whole, the Batman-esque portion of the game succeeds. Before we dive into the Middle-earth aspect, I should probably mention the Nemesis System.<br /><br /> Before the game’s release, the Nemesis System was widely anticipated, or at least it was by my friends and me. The concept of systematically taking over Sauron’s army and having Captains and Warchiefs remember past encounters with you seemed exciting. While the concept itself is there, it isn’t quite as good as I was expecting. My biggest complaint is that every time you attack a Captain or Warchief, a short cut scene plays where they taunt you, which is cool the first two times, but it became increasingly annoying throughout the game – while it doesn’t stop your combo streak directly, it does disrupt the flow because of the cut scene. The good news is that towards the end of the game, you get the Brand ability, which allows you to take over Captains, who you can use to infiltrate different levels of Sauron’s army and help you battle, which is really cool; the last couple story missions have you take control of five Warchiefs lead a small army to Mordor, which is awesome and reminded me of the ending missions of Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood (although I didn’t grow attached to these Uruks like I did with my assassin brothers). The bad news, however, is that I was about 85% done with the game by the time I unlocked this ability, so I was already sick of the whole Nemesis System. I think that if I would’ve had that ability by the first-third mark of the game, I would’ve enjoyed the system much more, but as it stands, it was OK and I think it can be improved upon in the sequel.<br /><br /> The last part to discuss would be the story. Basically, you play as Talion, a ranger who recently witnessed the murder of his wife and son. While you were executed as well, you were somehow not killed in the traditional sense; instead, you became merged with a Wraith, which is how you received your abilities and became a fierce killing machine. The plot involves you trying to take revenge upon your family’s killers, while also trying to figuring out your Wraith partner’s past, as he claims to not remember it himself. The plot is decent, but it flows like a traditional open-world plot a la Assassin’s Creed; you have your main objective, you meet other people who have slightly different objectives, you help them, they slightly help you, and you eventually become a hero who they can rally behind. There is a little more than that, but that is the basic jist of it and it didn’t interest me that much (aside from Gollum’s appearances, because I love that little Hobbit, and the humor of Ratbag and Torvin, who sadly don’t appear much throughout the game). The lore, on the other hand, is usually very interesting, especially when you collect an artifact and it expands upon a person’s backstory, like it did with Hirgon and Torvin – a few of the artifacts even mention Shelob, the giant spider from the latter portions of the novel/films, which I thought was cool. Unfortunately, if you aren’t a Tolkien geek, some of the lore can be a little rough to understand, so I wish it was a little more accessible, as I’m sure there are people who were interested in this game but weren’t huge fans of Middle-earth coming into it. For what is there, I yearned for more, but plot was decent and the lore was mildly interesting, so it does its job.<br /><br /> After everything I’ve discussed, what is my opinion on this game? Well, I think it is good, maybe even very good, but not great. The game takes some inspirations from Assassin’s Creed, but maybe a little too much, as I became bored with the game too quickly, and it also copies Arkham, but doesn’t do it as good as the original source. What the game does offer of its own, including the Nemesis System and the Middle-earth world, is good, but there is definite room for imporvement. Some parts of the game that I enjoyed and didn’t mention include the visions you have that are memories of your Wraith friend (they are beautifully stylized), the Tower of Sauron boss fight (not amazing, but has great atmosphere), and the Shadow Strike move, which allows you to point at an enemy, zoom across to him from afar (which helps when traveling), and take him out – one of the most badass parts of the game. I think that what this game has going for it the most is sequel potential. As of the writing of this review, the sequel has been announced and there has been footage shown, but I have not seen it, so I’m not sure of the direction. If they drop some of the repetitive aspects and improve on the original material, they can have a great game. For now, this is a solid title that most people would enjoy.", "ParentASIN": "B00WOK8YX4", "Timestamp": 1497732639644, "ItemName": "Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor Game of the Year - PlayStation 4", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.5, "RatingCount": 1544, "Price": 29.99, "Categories": ["Video Games", "PlayStation 4", "Games"], "Description": "In a new prequel to the Lord of the Rings, players can become a formidable force in Mordor by exploiting the fears and weaknesses of enemies to undermine Sauron's forces.

Once Super Mario 64 was released, there seemed to be no shortage of these games, as they were not just fun, but also a great expansion on the previous king, the 2D platformer. What is really interesting, however, is that the company Rare was responsible for many of the best games, including Donkey Kong 64, Conker’s Bad Fur Day, and, of course, the Banjo-Kazooie series. The only game, out of the ones I mentioned, that I have actually played is the first Banjo-Kazooie and although I enjoyed it, it wasn’t my favorite of the genre, although that could be because I grew up playing Sony’s platforming games (Spyro, Sly Cooper, Jak and Daxter, Crash, Ratchet and Clank, etc.). This game has been hyped for quite some time (just look at its Kickstarter funding) and many people were wondering if it would help to revitalize this once popular genre. Unfortunately, I don’t see that happening.<br /><br /> Let’s start with the positives. First of all, the game’s atmosphere is a nostalgic trip beyond belief. Even if you’re like me and didn’t play many Rare games, but you still played a few collectathon games, you’ll feel like a little kid again. I don’t know what it is about collecting hundreds of pieces of currency or finding a pagie/jiggie/the main collectible in a game, but it is oh so satisfying. A 3D platformer’s sense of accomplishment is, in my opinion, only rivaled by something like Dark Souls, and that’s only because those games are brutal. Aside from the collectibles, the game’s music is also wonderful, as I found myself constantly humming along – in fact, the music is so good, that even when I was frustrated (which happened frequently), I still kept humming along. It is so catchy and I must give props to the composers of the game (Grant Kirkhope, David Wise, and Steve Burke); the sound was probably the best part of the game and I applaud them for it. This brings us to the negative aspects of the game.<br /><br /> It isn’t that the following complaints are major problems (some are nitpicky), but when you have many small problems, it starts to disrupt the entire game. The biggest problem is the camera, which is not the worst camera in a video game, but it should be much better. This genre has always had its games with bad cameras - even the best of them have their problems - but for a game in 2017, I expected a lot better. You become used to it rather quickly and it isn’t that big of a deal, but I was very disappointed when I started playing right away. The second problem I have, and this might just be a really big nitpick, is the voices. Just like Banjo-Kazooie, the characters don’t actually speak, but instead use gibberish while we read the subtitles – I can’t remember if this annoyed me in Banjo-Kazooie, but I swear it has been the most annoying part of the last week. Seriously, how did no one making this game think “Hmm, this is getting a little annoying for us, maybe the players would get annoyed to.” I don’t want to turn the game volume down because I love the music and although you can skip most conversations by tapping a button, I shouldn’t have to (plus some conversations are not skippable). Nitpicky? Maybe, but I just couldn’t stand it. Those were the two biggest complaints I had, but don’t worry, there are more.<br /><br /> Each world in the game (there are 5) has a place where you can get transformed, which was also another feature in Banjo-Kazooie. Again, I don’t remember much from that game, but in this game, the transformations are awful. I don’t want to play as a flower or a snow plow that is barely controllable. Transformations aren’t a huge part of the game, so they should be fun little side missions that are really enjoyable, but nope, I dreaded all of them. There’s nothing wrong with playing as a flower (well, maybe there is a little), but these transformations don’t offer much in terms of expanded gameplay – you simply use them to get a couple pagies in the level and then boom, you change back. Speaking of small parts of the game, there are also minecart challenges, which start off fun, but they become so difficult that I found myself groaning whenever I saw the opportunity to play another one. Some goals can be hard, but these are filled with problems that don’t have much to do with difficulty, including awkward boosting/braking controls, a cannon that doesn’t have a high enough rate of fire to be very useful, and an awful camera that doesn’t let you see very far ahead. These were just two minor aspects of the game, but that doesn’t matter, they should have been the highlights of the game, but instead they were some of the lowest points for me.<br /><br /> Then there’s the whole issue of the levels themselves; they are too overwhelming when you first get there. To some people (probably most), having big levels with multiple pathways sounds great, but in this game, I just became confused where I was supposed to go, where I had already been, and which direction was which. While I prefer smaller levels in games (10 smaller levels instead of 5 giant levels would’ve been my preference), there is an even easier solution: have a map! It wouldn’t have fixed all of the problems, but it would’ve helped immensely. Not to mention, the game requires a lot of backtracking, usually because you don’t have all the power ups to solve every challenge, but you never know when that is. I remember playing some of the Spyro games and when you got to some areas where you needed a power up that you didn’t have, it would tell you so you didn’t waste time trying to solve an insolvable puzzle – again, we’re in 2017, this is not me complaining about the game needing handholding, but just simple aspects to make the game more fun. On the positive side, one of the few unique parts of this game are the ability to expand levels. When I was playing the first level, I realized that there was so much of the world I couldn’t access yet, which seemed weird for the first level, but then I realized once I collected enough pagies, I could expand it, essentially doubling the size. This would’ve been helpful to know right away, but once I figured it out, I really enjoyed this part of the game – it was refreshing.<br /><br /> As a whole, this game is not, by any means, terrible. It is a decent game that has many aspects of the typical 3D platformer, but it just doesn’t add enough new to the table. Here’s the best example I can use: Shovel Knight was released a few years ago to critical acclaim, but that wasn’t solely because of nostalgia; it was not only a nostalgic game for fans of the NES/2D platformer, but it also took some of the best elements from several games and mixed it all together to make its own unique game. Yooka-Laylee has the nostalgia aspect covered in spades, but it hardly adds anything fresh. Sure, some people want exactly that, but then why not just play your original games? As of this typing, I haven’t finished the game (about 60+% done, or 13 hours), but I don’t think I want to. Playing this game just made me want to go play some Spyro, so while the game is OK, I don’t know if I would recommend it to most people – just go play some classic platformers. This game’s really only for those who only have the newest consoles to play this genre, so unfortunately, I don’t entirely recommend this.

For one, most of the great games were available in either arcades or on the NES (Nintendo Entertain System, or Famicom in Japan). While arcades were great, Nintendo was becoming the dominant figure of video games, which wouldn’t be matched until the Sega Genesis came out in the next console generation and wouldn’t be bested until the Sony PlayStation came out another generation later. Almost inarguably, the most popular genre of games on the NES was the 2D platformer, which Mario helped to jumpstart. While those classic games are great, sometimes playing through them in this day and age, when we are so accustomed to superior hardware and refined controls, can be a tad difficult. Thankfully, this game does an amazing job of combining retro styled-games with the technology of today, providing not only a fine 2D platformer, but also a superb game in its own right.<br /><br /> One of the biggest reasons this game is so good is that it takes inspiration from many games, not just one. The game that I thought of most when playing through this was The Legend of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. For those of you unfamiliar with that game, Adventure of Link is considered the black sheep of the Zelda franchise, as it is the only sidescroller in the main series and, like the original game, is notoriously difficult. Despite this, however, the game is still very good, but because of the difficulty, even when using save states on the Virtual Console version, it is hard to replay. What Shovel Knight does is take some elements from this game, including an upgradeable health and magic bar, and puts it in a more forgiving experience. In addition to being an action-adventure sidescroller, the game also has various relics, which are nifty little items to help throughout the game – these are also featured in Adventure of Link- and villages to upgrade your character and purchase items (again, similar to towns in Link). Aside from that game, this also takes inspiration from DuckTales (the shovel drop bounce attack being just like Scrooge McDuck’s pogo jump, along with the large amount treasure in the game), Super Mario Bros. 3/World (the overworld map), and even Dark Souls (which I’ll elaborate on in a bit). The game takes some of the best elements from each of these to provide its own rich experience, and it works wonders. (Note: I’ve heard that the game is also very similar to Mega Man, but I have never played a Mega Man game, so I can’t say for sure.)<br /><br /> Obviously, the game is fun to play and that is enough reason to get it, but I was very surprised by the other exceptional parts of the game, most notably the story. Now, the plot is simple, but for the type of game this is (especially since its predecessors didn’t have gripping stories), I was pleasantly surprised. Firstly, the dialogue is quite humorous, as I chuckled quite a bit throughout the game; whether I was talking to bosses before an epic duel or asking for help from a giant, dancing fish creature, the game knows how to make the player smile. In addition to being quite funny, the game is also emotional; the prelude to the game establishes that Shovel Knight lost his companion, Shield Knight, before the events of the game and this has haunted him ever since – there are even a few short segments where Shovel Knight is dreaming and he is trying to save Shield Knight from a fall. As he catches her in the dream, he wakes, realizing that she is still gone. For an 8-bit styled platformer about a blue knight carrying a shovel as a weapon, I cared a lot about the story and characters. Aside from that relationship in the game, I also loved the characters of Polar Knight and Black Knight, both of who had a history with your character. The game doesn’t reveal much, but that is part of the reason it is great – the story isn’t shoved in our faces and we can fill in the holes ourselves. The game isn’t worth playing just for the story, but I am positive you wouldn’t be disappointed (especially with the great ending it has).<br /><br /> So, the game has great gameplay and a good story – but wait, that’s not all! The aspect of retro games that has probably aged best is the music and, again, the music isn’t something to solely play this game for (although a quick listen on YouTube wouldn’t hurt), it is still very good, and quite diverse. There are heroic tunes, like the title music, along with somber and almost depressing tunes like when Shovel Knight is resting at a campfire, dreaming of his fallen (or falling) partner. The level music for each level is also very catchy, as I found myself humming along a good chunk of the time (especially with Propeller Knight’s level – so catchy), and the boss music is frantic and fast-paced, providing the perfect atmosphere for the battles. Finally, the last trio of levels start off with epic music, symbolizing that you are near the end of your journey, then goes on to disturbing music that provides you with this eerie feeling, and ends with more depressing music (which, again, goes along with the great ending). Basically, the game has great music and, luckily, you can collect scrolls throughout the game that lets you listen to the music when wandering throughout the village, which is a nice way of making you want to collect stuff in the game. So, the game has tight gameplay, a solid story, and beautiful music, but what does it do wrong? Not much, but the game isn’t perfect.<br /><br /> Most of the complaints about this game are minor quibbles, but I still feel they should be stated since this is a review. Number One: the inspiration the game takes from Dark Souls is that you lose money upon death (although it is only a quarter of your total in this game, versus all of it in Dark Souls). You have one chance to reclaim it, but if you die before picking it back up, you lose that portion forever. While I understand that some people like this approach because it gives a consequence for dying, I don’t think it is necessary. Can’t dying and having to restart at a checkpoint be its own punishment? Like I said, some people like having a consequence, but I don’t, so your opinion may vary. Number Two: the difficulty. Throughout most of this game (I would guess approximately 70%), the game isn’t too bad – in fact, I think it was almost perfect. But, then it does what nearly all platformers do, which is ratchet up (reference intended) the difficulty towards the end. I was enjoying the game so much until that last third and while I still enjoyed the ending levels, they felt needlessly frustrating, especially with all the bottomless pits and instant-kill spikes. It isn’t too big of a deal, but it did upset me. Lastly, the bosses aren’t that varied. I didn’t find them hard (they were quite easy), but most of them could be beaten by just shovel dropping onto their head about twenty times. Yes, there is some slight variation amongst them, but aside from difficulty, that was my only (slight) disappointment with the game. It should, however, be noted that I beat the game, collecting all song scrolls and items, in under nine hours, but this is NOT a complaint, because the game is only twenty dollars and there is a new game plus mode, along with free DLC that lets you complete challenges and play as other characters – the game is really a steal.<br /><br /> If there was one last thing I had to say about this game, it would be this: thank goodness it exists. I grew up playing platformers and while I still play those old ones every now and then, you begin to realize how clunky they can be, with most of them aging poorly, so having a game that takes so many great elements from each of them, along with providing its own additions, makes this a treat. If you ever wanted to play one of those retro games, but didn’t want to hurl your controller across the room in frustration, this game is perfect. There are some small details that could be better, but what the game has going for it, including great controls, a varied item list, a touching story, and exemplary music, makes it completely worth it – buy this game now!", "ParentASIN": "B011AH9A16", "Timestamp": 1491692490000, "ItemName": "Shovel Knight - PlayStation 4", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 3.9, "RatingCount": 131, "Price": 53.92, "Categories": ["Video Games", "PlayStation 4", "Games"], "Description": "Shovel Knight combines handcrafted pixel art with modern technology, featuring detailed animations and evolved game design.

It is also a very long review, so you have been warned.<br /><br />The Uncharted series is one of the most critically acclaimed gaming series ever created, not to mention Sony’s flagship franchise and possibly Naughty Dog’s most popular series. The series is known for its combination of combat (both shooting and melee), light platforming elements, and short, yet fun puzzles that make you feel as smart as a college professor. There is also the wonderful cast of characters that carry an otherwise simple plot forward, the beautiful graphics that each game has brought (and which hold up relatively well), and Greg Edmonson’s wonderful scores. All of these components combine to form not only a fun game to play, but also what most consider to be the pinnacle of cinematic gaming. Some people will claim that the word cinematic should not be used when describing games, but I disagree based on the fact that there is nothing wrong with making movie-like videogames. Before I continue any further, it should be noted that although this is technically a review, it will be more of an overview of the entire series for people that have already played them. I will explain some aspects, of course, but it won’t be like a typical review.<br /><br />What These Games Are All About:<br />The series can be summarized as third-person shooters with elements of various genres, such as platforming and puzzle-solving. If you showed someone each of the 3 games, they probably couldn’t tell much of a difference because they are all very similar, but it is the numerous small additions that make the difference. The first two games look similar from a gameplay standpoint, but it is only when you actually play the games that you begin to notice just how many improvements were made between the two games. For example, the series is known for its set pieces, but it was the second game that really elevated them to a bigger and better level that gave the series its trademark. The games can only be evaluated if you analyze them closely, so on to the analysis.<br /><br />Analysis:<br /> I’ll do each of the games individually, but when something in one game applies to the entire series, it will be stated.<br /><br />PART I: The Original Adventure<br /><br />Gameplay:<br />The first major problem that I noticed when I replayed the trilogy was the way that the treasures are set up. I love 3D platforming games and I love collecting items, such as Jiggies in Banjo-Kazooie or Dragon Eggs in Spyro. These collectathon games work because of the way the levels are designed, with the entire point of the game being to collect items. This does not, however, work with Uncharted because it requires you to waste so much time looking at every nook and cranny, just to find a few shiny objects that serve no purpose for the story. You do get some cool rewards, but most people (including myself) just use an internet guide, which can detract from the experience because you are constantly looking back and forth between your TV and phone/computer. The other option is to look for them yourself, but that isn’t fun. This is made even worse when the third game doesn’t even include the rewards menu, so it is completely pointless unless you are a trophy hunter, and the first game doesn’t tell you how many are in each chapter. With it being said that I don’t like the treasure system, let’s move on to the other aspects of the game.<br /><br /> The first game’s cover system is not awful, but if you play the second game and then go back, it feels awful; it isn’t as smooth or fluid. Nate can only enter and exit cover, which doesn’t always work because sometimes he’ll just do a roll instead (a consistent problem in the series that doesn’t detract too much). Since he can only enter and exit, he can’t move to another piece of cover without first exiting his own, leaving him vulnerable to gunfire. This can cause a fair amount of frustration, especially on the harder difficulties.<br /><br /> Speaking of controls, the motion controls for grenade throwing is annoying. They fixed this in the remastered game and in the sequels, but I still wonder why they thought that it was a good idea in the first place. There is also the problem of picking up ammo and weapons, both of which are mapped to the triangle button (another problem that is in the entire trilogy). This is problematic when you are in the heat of battle and trying to get more ammo for your gun, but instead of doing that, you pick up a gun that you didn’t even want in the first place. It isn’t the worst mechanic in the world, but why couldn’t they have automatic ammo pick-up? The series isn’t exactly known for realism anyways. Again, these aren’t huge problems, but they do cause frustration.<br /><br /> People always complain about the shooting in the series, but I find that it controls well, even in the first game. It probably isn’t the best aiming mechanic in the world, but it serves its purpose just fine and I am able to get a decent amount of headshots, and I’m not even that good at the games. The first game does, however, suffer from awkward jumping controls, which are alleviated in the sequels (for the most part). The term that people seem to use a lot is floaty, which is accurate. Sometimes when you jump for a ledge, Nate just completely misses. The series’ platforming has never and probably will never be perfect, but I missed more jumps in this game than I did in any of the other games, which is yet another frustrating aspect.<br /><br /> Everybody also complains about the Jet Ski segments and how you can’t shoot and drive at the same time. I would say that this is more of an inconvenience for some people than an overall problem, since I didn’t mind it when playing through these levels. That pretty much sums up the negatives of the gameplay, so let me just finish up with this: the gameplay is still really fun and it has aged a lot better for me than for others. It isn’t perfect and it never was perfect, but the shooting is good, the selection of weapons is good (approximately 12 unique weapons), and although the cover system is troublesome, it is still bearable. Not bad for a 9-year old game<br /><br />Story:<br /> As far as the story and characters go, it is amazing at how different the writing is, despite the fact that it was the same creative writer for entire trilogy. That’s not to say that the writing or voice acting is bad, as it is actually the exact opposite. But, when you go from this game to the sequels, you see can see the improvements. There is one scene in the game where Elena wants Nate to continue looking for the treasure, while he says that it isn’t worth dying over.  This is very different from the third game, where she wonders why he continues this life. There are several factors that can cause this type of character change, but it can be easily explained by the fact that this was the first game in the series, so the developers were still working out the characters, and by the fact that people change. Elena realizes how dangerous this life is, while Nate realizes how much he loves the adventure. So, all in all, it doesn’t detract from anything, but it is worth mentioning.<br /><br /> Then there’s the whole plot twist that happens inside the vault. When I first beat this section of the game, I didn’t like it, but over time, I began to like it a lot and there are 2 main reasons for that: 1. It reminds me of Indiana Jones and the supernatural events that he has encountered and 2. Eddy Raja has a great line with “Don’t mess with Eddy Raja!” This is, unfortunately, followed by his death. Throughout the game, you get this feeling that Nate and Eddy are rivals that want each other out of the way, but can still banter back and forth. I would have loved to see more of Eddy, but alas, this was his only main game appearance.<br /><br /> The plot is relatively simple, but if you think too hard about it, you can find plot holes, so I recommend not thinking too hard about it. As a whole, it is an enjoyable plot with a fun cast of characters and the equivalent of going to see a high-quality pulp action movie.<br /><br />Design:<br /> The graphics have definitely aged, especially the character models, but the environment is still gorgeous to look at, so I can only imagine how wonderful it must have been to see it when it first came out. There is also the atmosphere of the bunker segments. The Uncharted series is definitely not known for horror, but these couple levels put me on the edge of my seat, as I was desperately trying to move on and escape from the dreaded Spaniards. It was some pretty scary stuff.<br /><br />Sound:<br /> The entire series has wonderful music, but it is the first game that has the worst, which again, does not mean that it is at all bad. This game just has the simple fact that almost everything about it was improved with the second game, including the musical score. Still, it had some nice tunes, although I couldn’t think of any on the top of my head.<br /><br />Difficulty:<br /> Maybe I suck at these games, but I found all of them to be hard, even on normal. I somehow beat all of them on the Crushing difficulty setting a while back, but I just kept dying over and over again on the Normal setting. This is definitely one of those game series that I recommend the Easy setting for because it allows for a better experience, plus you could actually do some melee kills without getting killed right away. Most people don’t find these games that difficult, but I still found all of them to be moderately hard.<br /><br />Replay Value:<br /> Depending on what you want from a game in terms of replay value, all of them could be sorely lacking or have a decent amount of replay value. I beat this game in about 6 hours, but I’ve beaten it 4 times for a total of roughly 30 hours. Obviously, that is still not a huge amount, especially if you don’t care to replay games for the story and basic shooting mechanics alone, so I’ll admit that the games have lackluster replay value for most people.<br /><br />Final Judgement:<br /> After all is said and done, I must say that although the first game has a lot of problems (from numerous gameplay quirks to a low replay value), it is still fun to play to this day. I would probably play through it a lot more if the sequel wasn’t better in almost every way, but this game is still worth playing for first-timers. I would give it a 9/10 for its time.<br /><br />PART II: What A Sequel Should Be<br /> First of all, the intro to this game is one of the best openings that any videogame developer has ever crafted. Nathan Drake is bleeding while hanging inside of a train dangling on the edge of a cliff. He slowly makes his way up and jumps at the last minute to safety. Everything about this level is almost perfect, from the atmospheric setting of the icy wasteland to the fitting soundtrack from Mr. Edmonson, it all fits. There is also the greatly improved graphics from the first game; graphics don’t mean everything, but good graphics don’t hurt this level at all. The way that the level will cut to flashbacks and make the player wonder what has happened is amazing. This level is probably one of the best uses of in media res, which means “into the middle of things” in Latin. This is easily the best Uncharted intro and also one of gaming’s best introduction levels.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /> The first improvement that I noticed about this game is the greater emphasis on stealth. Aside from the second level, there isn’t a moment that requires stealth, but it is fun to attempt to take out as many enemies as possible before chaos ensues. The second level perfectly encapsulates the greater variety in stealth takedowns, from pulling a guard down from a ledge to corner takedowns, it is a perfect example of minor improvements that make the world of a difference. I absolutely love silently taking out four guards in a row, getting caught by the fifth on accident, and then shooting them all. It is quite fun.<br /><br /> Another noticeable improvement is the cover system. Drake can now seamlessly transition from cover to cover by holding the analog stick and pressing the circle button. This is another minor improvement that makes the game a lot more fun because it allows for greater movement during combat without fear of being shot at while moving. Uncharted’s gameplay is all about moving around, so this definitely helps out a lot. As a side note, sometimes you’ll push down a table to make your own cover in certain areas; this is just something small that helps to add to the experience, so it is a nice touch. The cover system still isn’t perfect, but it is greatly improved.<br /><br /> Grenade throwing no longer uses motion controls (although it is an option for those that want it), so that is another improvement. Since we’re talking about grenades, I should also mention that the game now has approximately 19 unique weapons, which makes gunplay a little more exciting, with most weapons having an advantage over another. For example, I liked the M4 a lot in the last game, but sometimes I’ll switch over to the FAL in this game because it can zoom in and out via a scope, but it is only three-round burst, so it isn’t overpowered. I also think that the aiming is a bit improved, although it is nothing huge and if you hated the first game’s aiming, you would probably still dislike this game’s aiming.<br /><br /> The final minor change that has to do with gameplay alone is the melee combat. The first game’s combat was fine enough, but this game simplified it while also keeping it fun. You simply mash the square button to beat down an enemy, while pressing the triangle button to counter an enemy’s attack. You can still get killed quickly if you do this in the heat of battle, but when there are only one or two enemies left, it is great fun to go in for the kill.<br /><br /> The game also made the set pieces Uncharted’s defining trait, which has led some people to claim that because of how many cinematic they are, it is barely gameplay at all. Most of the people who claim this haven’t played them to realize that it is very easy to die during these segments. Ignoring that aspect, these are the most fun moments in the game and it is easy to see why so many people love them. My favorite set piece is probably the entirety of the train chapters, which leads me to my next point: the pacing.<br /><br /> This game has wonderful pacing that makes me not get bored at all when I play. From chapter 1 to around chapter 21, the pacing is almost flawless, with a near-perfect amount of gunfights, set pieces, and puzzles, along with a trio of chapters that build your relationship with someone whose language you don’t even understand. When you play it, it goes together almost perfectly. It starts to get a little boring with chapter 22 and 23, but that doesn’t last very long, so it is still exceptional pacing.<br /><br /> Just reading two pages make it seem as if the gameplay wasn’t improved as much as I (and many others) claim, but it is one of the situations where you would have to play the first and the second games to notice the difference. This game has several minor touches that make the overall experience smoother and, therefore, much more fun for the player.<br /><br />Story:<br /> I mentioned earlier on how the first game’s writing was quite good, but this is where they hit it out of the park. Drake now has more quips during gameplay, which are always fun to hear, and the character interaction is phenomenal. Even though The Last of Us had different creative directors, you can see that Naughty Dog has steadily improved their character depth over time and it was this game that made the giant leap. One especially funny chapter is the penultimate chapter twenty-five, which features both Chloe and Elene talking. Seeing as how both of these women have had/still have a thing for Drake, it leads to some clever and humorous dialogue. The Tenzin chapters in the mountains are also particularly noteworthy because Naughty Dog is able to craft a simple, yet very effective relationship between two people, neither of whom understand the other’s language. This two-person character relationship later became the foundation for The Last of Us.<br /><br /> Instead of droning on and on about how the writing and characters are a lot more fleshed out, I’ll just finish it off with the statement that it is wonderful. I would, however, like to point out that the ending is near-perfect. It isn’t groundbreaking, but it fits the story and features a good amount of tension, fear, and humor (heh, clowns). An amazing end to an amazing game<br /><br />Design:<br /> The graphics are even more gorgeous than the last game and, as always, Naughty Dog just continues to improve in this department. Seeing your footprints as you desperately fight your way through a blizzard or avoiding enemy gunfire as a hotel collapses is wonderful to not only play, but also to watch. There’s a reason that these are known as the best cinematic games by many people.<br /><br />Sound:<br /> The first game had a fine score, but this game’s score elevates everything to new heights. The introduction, the hotel-collapse, the helicopter battle on the train, and many more are just some of the highlights. Greg Edmonson’s score is one of the best that the seventh generation of consoles had to offer in terms of music. It was a treat for my ears.<br /><br />Difficulty:<br /> Just like the last game, I feel like the best way to play this game is on the Easy difficulty setting, but Normal is still doable; it just requires more patience and a willingness to be taken out of the moment sometimes with deaths. Again, maybe I just suck, but I would rather play it on Easy.<br /><br />Replay Value:<br /> The game’s replay value is roughly the same as the last game’s value, but it took me about 8 hours to complete the game this time, and I’ve put about 40 hours into it total with level replays and whatnot.<br /><br />Final Judgement:<br /> I, personally, think that this game definitely lives up to any hype that a person may or may not have. It isn’t perfect, but it is still so amazing and definitely one of those games that I recommend every gamer try out at least once. I would give it a very high 9.5/10.<br /><br />PART III: The Concluding Chapter<br /> The third game is probably the most divisive amongst fans. It isn’t as groundbreaking as the second game, but could still be seen as better than the original, depending on the person. The game still has many new additions to the game, but not every one is an improvement. Too some people, the lack of a groundbreaking sequel for the final game in the trilogy is very upsetting, but I still think that the game is very good.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /> Since the first level is almost entirely based on the new melee combat, it is probably best to start with that aspect. I do not like the new approach to combat in this game and although it can be ignored for the most part, in favor of just shooting enemies when you have weapons, I still got annoyed by it on many occasions. First of all, you can now grab enemies and throw them out of your way; this wouldn’t be that bad if this button wasn’t the same button that allowed you to evade enemies by rolling away. This means that if you decide to go in for a kill in the heat of battle, you won’t be able to dodge and the only way out of there is to just kill the enemy as fast as possible. This caused me too many frustrating deaths. Also, some scenarios have Drake fight ten or so enemies at once, making him seem like Batman, except that the combat isn’t nearly as fluid and can cause what looks like choppy animations to me. There are, however, some new enhancements to the combat which I did enjoy. Firstly, Drake has some new animations (such as whacking a guy with his gun if he only has one hit left or using a nearby fish to slap someone) and sometimes when he fights a guy, he’ll pull his grenade pin off before kicking him away. The best addition is probably when you don’t have a gun and you defeat someone with a gun, which will cause Drake to automatically take it once you defeat the guy. I like a lot of these new features, but I still feel that, as a whole, the combat is subpar because of the choppy animations and awfully implemented grab move.<br /><br /> In addition to the hand-to-hand combat, there are also a couple of new stealth moves. These are hardly game-changing, but they are better to have than to not have. The first one is being able to drop directly onto an enemy from a ledge to take him down (useful when you get the chance, but that isn’t very often) and the second is being able to jump onto an enemy when you have the high ground, but this doesn’t always work because you have to wait for the square button prompt to appear, which it doesn’t always do. Again, not major, but it is better to have them than to not have them.<br /><br /> The weapons in this game are mostly the same as the last game (with slight variations, such as a G-MAL instead of a FAL), totaling at approximately 20 unique weapons. They are still fun to use, but it is not as fun as going from the first game’s weapons to the second game’s weapons. In all fairness, I don’t really see what they could’ve added without just making improved versions of pre-established weapons. As a last note, you can also throw back grenades by tapping the triangle button at the right time when it lands near you. Why do you have to tap the triangle button at a specific time, I hear you ask? I suppose the only reason for that is to make it so that you don’t throw every single grenade back perfectly. I can see why they made it the way that they did, but it seems rather silly in my opinion.<br /><br /> That is pretty much all that they added to the gameplay, although it should be stated that the game’s pacing isn’t nearly as well-done as the second game. The first half of the game is by no means boring, but it is definitely slower paced than the second half. This is made up for by the fact that the second half of the game has the wonderful set pieces, such as the cruise ship, the cargo plan, and the caravan ride, not to mention a few hallucinogenic episodes that our dear Drake experiences. These are great fun, but nearly all of the set pieces are in the second half, whereas the previous game had them pretty evenly spread apart. This isn’t a huge problem, but it could’ve been better.<br /><br /> As a whole, the gameplay is still really fun, but it just doesn’t have the same leaps and bounds as the last game, which was expected, seeing as how the last game was one of the most critically-acclaimed games of all time (and still is). Not bad, but not nearly as groundbreaking<br /><br />Story:<br /> The voice acting is still top-notch and the characters are still a great deal of fun, but this game tries to take itself a little more serious than the last game, which is, for the most part, refreshing. I like the two flashback chapters because they helped flesh out Drake as a character instead of just being a random dude who is an expert at climbing and shooting with guns. Sully is also shown to be more of a father figure to him, too, which is great because it was never really clear what their relationship was. My favorite addition to the game is probably Cutter, who is Drake’s intellectual equal and is into this treasure hunting business as much as he is. Unfortunately, he doesn’t even appear for half of the game because his voice actor had some other obligations to attend. This explains why his character seems rushed out of the story, but it doesn’t make it any better for the game.<br /><br /> The villains in the game are better than the first game’s villains, but I like Lazarevic and Harry more than Marlowe and Talbot. Sure, Lazarevic is just a basic war overlord, but it was still fun to see him in all of his scenes. Marlowe has some cool moments, such as when she reveals how much she actually does know about Drake’s past, but it is Talbot who is the real villain. He drugs not only Cutter, but also Nate as some point and it leads to an interesting segment. Not to mention that Nate also thinks that he killed Sully at one point, which is phenomenal because you see how much Sully means to him. Nate specifically says that he’ll kill Talbot while chasing him down; granted, Nate kills hundreds of nameless mercenaries throughout the game, but never for revenge or out of cold blood. Like all of the games, this one will have plot holes if you think too hard about it, but as a whole, the storyline aspect is solid. I just wish that Cutter would’ve appeared more often.<br /><br />Design:<br /> Of course, the graphics have improved yet again, but Naughty Dog has also gotten really talented with atmosphere, too. The previously mentioned hallucinogenic segments are creepy, but the entire chapter set within the Rub’ al Khali desert is also great in its own unique way. Nate stumbles through the sand, desperately searching for water or any sign of help, and as the chapter moves on, Marlowe starts speaking in the background. This could mean a number of things, but the fact that it is open to interpretation is another great aspect. There are other great design elements, but that chapter is probably the best in terms of atmosphere.<br /><br />Sound:<br /> The music is about as good as the last game, although that is very subjective. Some recognizable moments for me include the Cartagena chase and the Rub’ al Khali music. This is another great score for not only the series, but also for the video games in general.<br /><br />Difficulty:<br /> Like the last two games, I found this to be most enjoyable on the Easy setting. There isn’t much else to say.<br /><br />Replay Value:<br /> This game took me about seven hours to complete, so somewhere in between the first and second game. I’ve put about 30 hours into this game total over the course of three games.<br /><br />Final Judgement:<br /> The game is still very, very good, but it lacks the originality of the first game and it lacks the innovative appeal of the second game, but it also retains many of the same elements that made the second game so popular. I would probably give it a 9/10, as it is still a blast to play and experience.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /> The entire trilogy, when played back-to-back as I just did, is quite amazing. Each game has its ups and downs, with the second game being the high point, but they are all worth playing. If you do an average of the scores, you get about a 9-9.25/10, which is fantastic for an entire trilogy. Each game has held up relatively well, but it is the consistent quality that makes the series so amazing. This is one of those game series that is wonderful for almost anyone, unless, of course, you hate games with a character-driven focus.

Some people have also claimed that the series is simply a video game version of Indiana Jones or Tomb Raider with a male protagonist. Whether or not you fully agree with either of those 2 statements, there is no doubt that this game has some similarities with the Uncharted series. As someone who hasn’t played the other games in this usually well-received series, I can’t comment on how different or similar it is to the other games, but I can safely say that as a fan of the Uncharted games, this game is amazing.<br /><br />What This Game is All About:<br />The game starts out with you and your crew becoming shipwrecked on an island, separating everybody. The entire game is not just about finding a way off of the island or even about surviving the insane inhabitants, but also about uncovering the mysterious secrets that the island holds. Lara starts the game as a researcher setting out for adventure and knowledge, but throughout the game, she learns what she must do in order to survive. The game is made up of climbing, shooting, light stealth elements and puzzle-solving, and collecting items, all while leveling up Lara’s skills and upgrading/modifying her weapons. The game is linear, but the areas contain various items and treasures to find, with each item containing a story for the island. Using campfires to rest, you can fast travel to previous areas around the island to upgrade Lara. The concept isn’t completely original, but that doesn’t make it any less fun.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /> The core of the game is composed of climbing the environment, solving simple puzzles, and defeating enemies, much like Uncharted. There are, however, several differences between the two. The first of these is the weapons; this game only has 4 weapons, but you can upgrade these and add parts to them throughout the game, making them more your own. The weapons include a bow (which is perfect for sniping your foes when in stealth), a pistol (your basic firearm), a rifle (your all-around weapon), and a shotgun (which is great for close encounters). Some of the better upgrades include grenade-tipped arrows for the bow, a silencer for the pistol, and a scope for the rifle, among simpler upgrades that include increasing magazine size and decreasing recoil. These are all useful and it gives you an incentive to want to collect salvage in crates and loot enemy corpses.<br /><br /> Lara can also gain XP from defeating enemies, with more XP given for unique takedowns. By including a simple level system in the game, there is a good reason to try to defeat enemies in certain ways and to actually collect items (although there are other reasons for that, too). With each level Lara gains, you get one skill, of which there are 24. Some of my favorite include the dodge-to-kill move (after dodging an enemy’s melee attack, you can stab them in the head with an arrow), a close-range shotgun kill (used on wounded enemies), and the ability to pick up arrows off of dead enemies and animals. Just like the weapon upgrades, this is a simple system that provides a sense of satisfaction throughout the game. Not only is Lara, as a character, changing, but you, as a player, are increasing your skills and gear. These make the game a lot more enjoyable.<br /><br /> Coming into this game, I knew that it would have set pieces like in Uncharted, but I did not expect them to be on the same level. There are probably a good dozen or so of them and every single one is exhilarating and breathtaking. Are they over the top? Absolutely, but that doesn’t make them any less fun or enjoyable. It is a great achievement when I can compare these to Uncharted’s set pieces in a positive light. I should also add that while the moment when you first get the grenade launcher attachment for the rifle isn’t really a set piece, it is by far one of the best moments in the game; pummeling your enemies with a newfound explosive was better than I could have anticipated.<br /><br /> As stated previously, the game does have items to collect, but they aren’t too much of a nuisance. You gain XP from collecting them and most of them provide a decent backstory. The relics are the equivalent of treasures from Uncharted, but each of these have a description with them, allowing for you to actually learn more about them. There are also GPS caches, but aside from gaining XP, these are relatively pointless. The last type of collectible is the document, which are just little notes that explain the story in greater detail. These are always a joy, whether it was written by a World War II Japanese soldier, one of your shipmates, or even the main antagonist of the game; everyone is interesting and makes the overall story and game more enjoyable.<br /><br /> There aren’t any major negatives to the game, but the one part that bugged me the most were the tombs. I don’t know what they were like in past games, but in this game, they are just small, optional areas with a short puzzle to solve. There are about 10 of them in the game, but everyone can be completed in less than 10 minutes, some in less than 5 minutes, which is really disappointing. Maybe this is wrong of me, but I was expecting something more akin to the Assassin’s Creed tombs, which are much longer and much more enjoyable. The tombs are by no means<br />bad or annoying (they are still fun), but I was disappointed.<br /><br /> Those are the core concepts of the game. It really isn’t that complicated or innovative, but it excels at almost every gameplay aspect that it attempts to, which is all that you can ask.<br /><br />Story:<br /> The story is good, but when compared to the Uncharted games (I know that I’ve done a lot of comparing with that series), it lacks. Uncharted might not have original plots, but they have wonderful characters that carry it, while this game is full of bland characters. They aren’t that bad, but even Lara is a little boring. That being said, there are, however, some great aspects in this department, such as the entire opening sequence, which perfectly captures the fear of being shipwrecked. The game is also a lot darker than one might expect, which I was pleasantly surprised by. It isn’t cringe-inducing, but since I’m comparing it to Naughty Dog’s Uncharted, I might as well compare it to The Last of Us, which it leads towards much more in terms of a dark story. The notes that you can pick up to read are also just like those in The Last of Us, which is another good quality. Overall, it is still pretty good, even if it isn’t perfect.<br /><br />Design:<br /> The graphics are good and the views are gorgeous when you reach a high point, but the atmosphere is another aspect that I was pleasantly surprised by. There are 2 areas that are specifically frightening and actually made my heart beat a little faster. The first of these is the Geothermal Caverns area, which is a dark area with prisoners screaming in pain and the second is the entire ending sequence. Note: Skip to Sound if you don’t want a slight spoiler for this or Uncharted. The Samurai in this game are also a lot more terrifying than most of the monsters in the Uncharted games (excluding the first game’s zombie-like creatures), not to mention the fact that they have giant swords to strike you down with.<br /><br />Sound:<br /> The sound in the game is fine, with particular praise given to the thunder and gun sounds. The music isn’t completely memorable, but there are a couple instances where it did stick out quite a bit, the most notable moment being when I first climbed the radio tower. Overall, it was fine.<br /><br />Difficulty:<br /> The game has 3 difficult options and while playing on normal, I died here and there, but I never got too frustrated, so it is good overall.<br /><br />Replay Value:<br /> I don’t know the exact time it took me to beat the game 100%, but I would estimate that it took me anywhere between 15 and 20 hours, which is a good length for this type of game. Even if that isn’t a good length for you, the game is definitely still worth it.<br /><br />Final Judgment:<br />This game is RECOMMENDED. Some people have said that this game is the worst Tomb Raider game, but the best Uncharted game. I don’t know how similar it is to the original series, but I can assure you that if you liked the Uncharted games, there should be no reason for you to dislike this game. This is how you reboot a series for a new generation.<br />FINAL SCORE= 9.25", "ParentASIN": "B00HM1XPN4", "Timestamp": 1467400087000, "ItemName": "Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition - Xbox One", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.7, "RatingCount": 1189, "Price": 28.99, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Xbox One", "Games"], "Description": "Experience the critically acclaimed action-adventure game, reimagined for next-gen consoles.

Yes, games such as Ocarina of Time are technically open world, but they aren’t what people would think of nowadays. Although still very popular, platformers have been winding down lately. The first Jak and Daxter game was a critical and commercial success (earning a 9.25 from me). While many people expected a second platformer game that improved upon the success of its predecessor, this sequel actually took a radical change in design (and I’m not just talking about removing Daxter from the title).<br /><br />What This Game is All About:<br />Note: Spoilers for the first game in the series.<br />If you finished the first Jak and Daxter game 100%, you would receive the secret ending, which is a huge cliffhanger. This game reveals that the group found a mysterious Precursor artifact known as the Rift Gate. While trying to get it to work, they end up opening a portal, which summons dark creatures. They get thrust into the portal and separated, with only Daxter and Jak remaining together. After landing in a hi-tech city, guards knock Jak out while Daxter escapes. 2 years pass and Daxter is able to save Jak from a prison where he was being pumped full of Dark Eco, which would’ve killed you in the last game. He goes a little psycho on Daxter by turning into a monster, but he is able to regain himself. The game then has you and Daxter try to find out where you are and how to get back to your own place, all while trying to uncover mysteries of all sorts.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /> This game took a radical departure from its predecessor. The biggest differences include an open world, guns, PG-13 dialogue and themes, and a much more engrossing story that will keep you captivated until the end, but I digress. In terms of the open world, it is a huge place called Haven City. Like GTA, you travel around the city to start missions that are shown on your mini map, but some of these missions are outside of the city walls, allowing you to explore levels, too. While the city is really just a place and isn’t the best area to just free roam, it is still a cool place that shows how different this game is. You travel around using zoomers, which have sloppy controls and are usually a pain to handle, but you get used to it (for the most part, because the 4 races in the game are a pain). You can also trigger an alarm if you attack a guard, but this isn’t a good thing, because you end up accidentally flying into them when trying to navigate the populated crowds in the city. Luckily, you don’t have to lose them to start a mission; you just have to get there.<br /><br /> The missions themself are fun and interesting, especially the ones that take you outside of the city walls, such as the Mountain Temple. These are usually where some platforming segments that are more reminiscent of the last game occur, although some areas are really just meant<br />for gunplay, which brings us to our next point.<br /><br /> The guns work well in the game and I enjoyed the addition to the game, even if it almost completely changes the direction of the series. Instead of using Eco to power up Jak, you get 4 different guns throughout the game. The Scatter Gun (Red Eco) is a short-range shotgun type of weapon that is great for hordes of small critters that are ganging up on you, while the Blaster Gun (Yellow Eco) is your standard gun that is also great for long-range enemies (it is also useful if you combine it with your jump spin attack). The Vulcan Fury (Blue Gun) is a machine gun that is perfect for when you are being overwhelmed or just need high rate of fire, and last, but certainly not least, is the Peace Maker. One of your allies uses this gun in the game and it is a great tease because you actually get to use it later. You charge up an electrical shock and release it; it will home in on an enemy and shock nearby enemies as well. The ammo is limited, but it is great for using against guards who drop ammo.<br /><br /> Despite the guns being awesome, there are some flaws. You can’t aim, which I didn’t mind for over ¾ of the game, but when you are getting swarmed by enemies and need to conserve ammo, it does get a little annoying. There is also the ammo problem: since the game has no currency to buy anything, you have to find ammo in crates or off of dead guards. This is fine, but sometimes when you enter a new area, the crates don’t have enough ammo or any of the ammo for the gun that you want to use. This creates a problem in some scenarios, but it is a minor complaint.<br /><br /> Do you remember the monster that Jak turns into at the beginning of the game? You get to use him throughout the game by collecting Dark Eco in small amounts (they are left by the creatures known as Metal Heads). When your meter is full, you can go berserk on your foes. I only used it about 5 times throughout the whole game, but it is still useful and a great asset in tough situations. You can upgrade this power by meeting with an Oracle at the docks (you have to give it Skull Gems, which are dropped by defeated Metal Heads).<br /><br /> So the game seems to have a nice setup for the main storyline, but what about side missions? There isn’t much to say that is good, but they are here. The side missions are found throughout the city and usually require you to either find an area with a Precursor Egg or complete a racing challenge. These are usually very frustrating and difficult, so I don’t recommend them unless you want all of the orbs. There are a total of 286 orbs in the game, which seems like a lot, but they are done in poor ways. The hidden ones are awful to find because it doesn’t tell you how many are in each level, so if you beat the game, you have no idea if you found them all in a given area. The side missions aren’t that fun, but there are also optional races and gun courses to complete, but like the side missions, these are frustrating and difficult, but to an insane level. The only positive aspect of these is that you only need 200 of the orbs to unlock everything, so if you use a guide, there is some leeway on the missions. If you<br />manage to collect 200 of the orbs, you unlock Hero Mode, which is basically New Game Plus.<br /><br /> The gameplay is very different from the last game because of the addition of an open world (which is different than the last game’s seamless world), guns being incorporated, and a few other things here and there (such as a sweet Jet-Board). While I think that the gameplay is better in the last game because of its focus on being a platformer alone instead of a hybrid, I still think that this game is great with its gameplay.<br /><br />Story:<br /> The game improved the story from just having fun characters to being a darker tale with plenty of humor, intriguing characters, revelatory plot twists, and an awesome ending. This game’s story is amazing and it is definitely my favorite aspect of the game. You continue to complete missions not only because the gameplay is good, but because the story keeps you going. Daxter is even more hilarious in this game because he is no longer restricted by an E rating, while Jak can now talk and this gives himself an actual character. Samos and Keira return, but there is a slew of new characters that are just as intriguing, maybe even more so. These include Sig (the lovable hit man for Krew, who is the crime boss that you work for to get gun mods), Torn (one of the leaders of the Underground, who rebel against Baron Praxis), and Vin (the nervous wreck of a nerd who is hilarious, too). This game has a great plot, a great cast of characters, and a great presentation in how everything is revealed. The ending moments of the game have some great plot twists and I completely enjoyed the game’s story.<br /><br />Design:<br /> The game’s city and characters are beautifully animated, which is greatly noticed during the game’s cutscenes. These are some of the best graphics on the PS2 and instead of the game being a brightly colored world that is stunning to look at, it is a dark and gloomy city with towering sights that is still stunning to look at.<br /><br />Sound:<br /> The game’s music isn’t bad by any means, but it just didn’t pop like it did in the last game, but the sound effects are phenomenal, especially the sound of your footsteps in some cutscenes and the noise that your gun makes. Okay music, great sound effects<br /><br />Difficulty:<br /> The game’s difficulty is cheap, not hard. Most missions aren’t hard at all, but they aren’t easy. It is just the fact there most missions don’t have checkpoints, which means that if you get 90% of the way through and die for some reason, you have to do it all again. This makes some missions seem harder than they actually are. The races are also no fun because you can get destroyed pretty easily and you have 5 laps to go in each race. There are harder and cheaper games out there, but this game is no cakewalk because of said cheap mechanics.<br /><br />Replay Value:<br /> The game takes about 15 hours to complete and while there is a Hero Mode and side missions to complete, you’ll probably not want to get 200 orbs. Even if you don’t do those modes, the game’s story is about 15 hours in length and I would surely replay it for the phenomenal story.<br /><br />Final Judgment:<br />This game is RECOMMENDED. The game is vastly different from its predecessor and while I may have enjoyed some aspects of the prequel more (such as the gameplay, to a small extend, and the music), the replay value is greater because of the longer game and the story is amazing. It isn’t perfect, but this game is still great and a solid sequel.<br />FINAL SCORE= 9.25", "ParentASIN": "B000099T1Y", "Timestamp": 1464134881000, "ItemName": "Jak II - PlayStation 2", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.6, "RatingCount": 532, "Price": 9.99, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation 2", "Games"], "Description": "Join Jak in a new game world filled with fresh missions and platformer levels.

I loved how the game advanced from a basic platformer with light stealth elements to small open worlds with a mission-based structure, along with a couple more characters to use. There was also the darker, but still fun, story that kept you going. This third time around, the developer tries some new things, some which are okay, some are great, and a couple aren’t that great. As a whole, the trilogy goes off with great game that is more than worthy of its name.<br /><br />What This Game is All About:<br /> This review is presuming that you are familiar with the last 2 games in the series and, as such, may contain spoilers (both story and gameplay) for those that haven’t played them.<br /><br /> On the outside, the game is very similar to the last game: you have several levels that are small open worlds with missions to complete in the world and inside smaller levels. The game adds more playable characters (although these can’t be used in free roam) and more minigames. It doesn’t seem like the formula was tweaked that much on the outside, but you start to notice the changes when to play it a lot more.<br /><br /> As far as the premise goes, Sly learns from an informant that his family had a vault where they stored all of their treasure (it was appropriately named the Cooper Vault). However, someone owns the island where it is on and it is a fortress that would be very difficult to get into. In order to solve this, it is decided to gather a gang of thieves to help get into the place, with each thief having their own special ability. The game centers on traveling to different places, with each place garnering you a new recruit.<br /><br />Note: The game had an optional 3-D mode for certain areas in the game, but I didn’t use it.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /> Let’s start with the parts that were neither great nor terrible additions to the game. During a few parts of the game, you must engage in dialog choice-scenarios with another character, usually to convince him or her. There are only about 5 of these throughout the game and they aren’t that great, but I didn’t dread the moment whenever they came. I just completed them and moved on with the game.<br /><br /> There are also about 4 parts of the game where you must crack a safe by slowly rotating the analog stick to the right, to the left, and to the right again, stopping whenever you hear a vibration. I thought that this would add to the thieving parts of the game, but it wasn’t used a lot and it didn’t always work out, because the vibration would happen, but it would sometimes reset when you went to turn back. It wasn’t awful, but it was meh.<br /><br /> Throughout some of the levels, there are also traps that can be activated by pressing a switch, which are perfect for when you are trying to escape the guards. I didn’t use them all that much and found them to be unnecessary, but I suppose that it is better to have them there than it is to not have them at all.<br /><br /> Sly can also acquire 3 disguises for 3 of the levels in the game. These allow him to be caught by guards, where he must then recite a password that Bentley gives him. It is only used for about 4 missions in the game and it was pointless to use when exploring the level, not to mention I got sick of the button memorization early on, but Sly does do a fancy walk when he has one of these outfits on, so there is that.<br /><br /> I enjoyed most of the new characters a lot, but 2 of them were only okay to me. The game has you explore underwater, but it is for only 2 levels, the latter of which is more of a minigame/boss. I liked these-first person underwater segments, but I didn’t love them and since there was only one real level, it never got the chance to grow on me. Also, Bentley and Murray can now pickpocket (Bentley via a magnetic fishing pole and Murray by shaking the loot out of guards that he is carrying).<br /><br /> The game has added Master Thief Challenges, which are basically missions that you have already done, but with a restriction to make it harder (time limit, half health, etc.). These were okay, but I got a little bored with repeating the same missions with minute tasks. If the challenges were presented as optional objectives when you first played the mission, then I wouldn’t have had to repeat most of them. They are, at best, decent.<br /><br /> There aren’t that many truly negative parts to the game, but there are 2 that I didn’t care for at all. The first was the new RC chopper. Eventually, you get a new team member to use an RC car and RC chopper, the former of which is fine, but the latter is annoying. In the previous game, you could drop bombs on enemies, but in this game, you release a hook to grab enemies, and then you must boost your chopper to send them flying. The reason that I hate this is because it is hard to be accurate when you drop the hook because it swings in a weird motion while dropping, not to mention that dropping bombs on enemies is easier to control than trying to grapple and boost away.<br /><br /> The other part of the game that bugged me was the lack of treasure to collect in the world and the lack of clue bottles. In the last game, you could collect 3 treasures in each world to return to your base and get coins. There is nothing like that in this game, which makes collecting coins tedious as you must pickpocket many guards to get a lot of coins. Later in the game, there is a really easy and very fun way to get coins, but by then, you don’t need most of the power-ups. The lack of clue bottles upsets me because they were a fan favorite in the previous 2 games. While some people might not like them because it seemed like tedious collecting, I loved it because it gave me a chance to explore the world before starting the missions. By the time that I had finished collecting them all, I had a good grasp of the level that I was about to tackle. It is a shame to see that they got rid of these.<br /><br /> The game has, however, made several improvements by adding more characters, which keep the game from getting boring because of the variety. Carmelita is now playable with her shock pistol, where it is played like a third-person shooter, and these were some of the best missions in the game, even if they were usually quick and easy. The game also has you play as a Guru, who is able to take control of guards and use them to crash into certain obstacles that are mission targets. There is also a person who can use fireworks to defeat several enemies at once by locking onto them while loading his launcher. All of these characters are fantastic, with the only problem is that you never get to use them for more than a few times, but they are fun while you do.<br /><br /> There are also 3 segments in the game where Sly must use a biplane. For a platform game with light stealth features, the flying controls really well and was very fun. You could shoot down enemy planes and turrets, dodge incoming fire, and even do a nice loop-de-loop. Classic dogfighting<br /><br /> The game’s bosses have also been improved, and while there was nothing wrong with the other games’ bosses, this game improves them significantly. One of my favorite bosses prior to this game was Jean Bison, but some of the bosses in this game give him a run for his money. From General Tsao in his mystical area to the monster known as Crusher, the bosses were significantly improved and a lot more fun to defeat.<br /><br /> While playing through the game, I wasn’t sure if I really liked it as much as the last game, but once I got halfway through episode 5, my view completely shifted. Episode 5 is possibly my favorite level in any Sly game. In it, you get to use a map to find buried treasure by using clues from the map. This was a fun moment and what made me like the Master Thief Challenges at the end, because once you got the map, there was an extra challenge in each of the worlds, which were fun to solve. Once you dig up the treasure, you get to go onto open waters and control a pirate ship! The sailing is easy and responsive, while the sea battles are amazingly well done and a joy to do. You can shoot at enemy ships while trying to dodge fire yourself or get up close and personal and just try to outlast them with your greater health. Once the last ship is one its last hinge, you can send them to Davy Jones’ Locker or get on board and take out the captain, scoring you even more loot. These parts of the game awesome because it is fun, you get a lot of coins from it, and they are mostly optional (except for a couple of story missions where you must fight). Not only that, but this episode also contains Crusher, the great boss, and the episode finishes off with a fantastic operation that completes the episode. This is the episode that made me love the game. There is also the fact that it leads into a great opening for the final episode, which really sets the stage for the finale. All in all, it was simply wonderful.<br /><br /> At first, the game may seem similar to its predecessor, but the greater cast of characters (which are mostly fun to use), the biplane segments, the great sailing (and all of episode 5), and a few small tweaks make this game just as fun as the last game.<br /><br />Story:<br /> The game’s story is fun, but it has some great moments that make it more than just the average story. Episode 1 deals with Murray feeling guilty over Bentley’s handicap state, which adds some great character development for Murray. Some characters from the first game return and are not mistreated, but a nice homage, with one of them being more of a three-dimensional character (the other is just fun to hear). The game is also cool in that it opens up with a prologue set at the beginning of the last mission, but then cuts back, which builds up the moment. Episode 6 itself deals with some themes of selfishness and friendship in ways that aren’t dark or immature, and it gets the point across. The end credits scene is also nice, even if it does leave a cliffhanger (although some may think that it wraps the series up rather nicely). The only part that I didn’t enjoy was Carmelita’s new voice, which has changed with each game. It isn’t bad, but it is weird when you have played the other games. Personally, my favorite voice for her was in the last game.<br /><br />Design:<br /> The game still has the comic book-inspired design and it is still a wonder to look at. The game does, however, have a brighter color palette, which isn’t bad, but it is noticeable. I liked the darker palette of the last game, but the brightness is good, too.<br /><br />Sound:<br /> The music is still great, but I liked the last game’s music more. I felt that Sly 2’s music was more noticeable, but to say that this game’s music is bad would be a disservice. It is still great music and a treat for your ears.<br /><br />Difficulty:<br /> Due to the variety of minigames and characters, the game is actually the hardest in the series because you have to play several different ways. The game is still easy and never gets hard, but it is definitely harder than the last 2 games.<br /><br />Replay Value:<br /> The game should take you about 15 hours to complete, which is a little less than the last game. I think that the Master Thief Challenges took about as much time as it did to collect all the clue bottles in a level, but the game now only has 6 episodes instead of 8. Still, it is worth a buy.<br /><br />Final Judgment:<br />This game is RECOMMENDED. It tries some new ideas out and lot of them are okay (while a couple are bad), but it also adds a lot of great ideas, from the unique characters to the fun flying and the amazing pirate episode, it is still a great game to add to the series, especially for the final episode’s story resolution and epilogue.<br />FINAL SCORE= 9.25", "ParentASIN": "B0009F3E1I", "Timestamp": 1462852606000, "ItemName": "Sly 3 Honor Among Thieves - PlayStation 2", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.6, "RatingCount": 697, "Price": null, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation 2", "Games"], "Description": "In Multiplayer mode, players can engage in split-screen cooperative missions and mini-games.

Although the title of this newer game is different, it can be considered a sequel (or a spiritual successor). I greatly enjoyed my time with Demon’s Souls and although I had a few problems with it, I still recommended it to people who would take the time to become invested with it. The question then, is whether or not this game fixes those problems and surpasses the original game that started it all. Overall, my main problems weren’t fixed, but at the same time, I feel that the game improved upon its predecessor in many ways.<br /><br />What This Game is All About:<br /> The game is very similar to Demon’s Souls. If you are not familiar with it, check out my review of that game or look some information up. This section will be focused on some of the core changes.<br /><br /> The biggest change is the fact that the game is not a hub with different levels to choose from, but rather one large and expansive world that is all interconnected. You’ll end up finishing one area and start to wonder where you’ll end up next, only to be at an area that you were at 3 hours ago. The game also has bonfires scatted around the world. These are essentially checkpoints throughout the land where you can level up, upgrade weapons, and, later on in the game, warp to other specific bonfires. The game also uses human and undead forms, instead of a soul form. Thankfully, you no longer lose half of your health when in soul form. There are other changes, but they’ll be discussed within the gameplay section. Onward!<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /> As mentioned above, the biggest additions are the open-world and bonfires. At first, I didn’t like it any more or less than the level feature in Demon’s Souls, but it eventually grew on me and now I absolutely love it. It is amazing to travel for hours upon hours, reach a high point, and gaze downward at an area that you cleared last week. While this greatly affects the game’s overall atmosphere, it also affects the gameplay. It gives the game a 3D Metroidvania feel; finishing an area and finding a shortcut to a previous area is wonderful, especially because you’ll most likely be a powerful warrior and the area won’t seem as hard anymore. You also don’t always have to beat a boss in order to receive a checkpoint; bonfires scattered throughout the world rectify that problem and it was a great addition.<br /><br /> The game also replaces grass (Demon’s Souls’ healing item) with Estus Flasks. Depending on how much you’ve upgraded that specific bonfire, you could have anywhere from 5 to 20 on you at a time. This is another great addition because it not only eliminates the need for farming, but because they also refill when you reach a new bonfire or die and reset at an old one. Now, you don’t have to worry about collecting more grass because you died from a fight.<br /><br /> Speaking of items, the upgrade system has also been improved, although it still isn’t perfect. The upgrade materials are a lot more abundant and it is much easier to find out which ones are suited for your character and play style, but like the last game, if you don’t know what you’re doing, you could end up wasting valuable resources. Still, the simplification of the system keeps everything essential about it intact and as long as you don’t spend your materials willy-nilly, you should be fine.<br /><br /> The game has added some small enhancements that enrich the overall experience and fix some of the problems that many people had. These include, but are not limited to, having an item burden (there no longer is one), a new jump attack (great for eliminating most of a tough enemy’s health bar), making spells less overpowered (they now have a set number of uses per life), and having some tougher enemies not respawn for that playthrough. That last part seems minor, but I’ve smiled several times when I took several minutes trying to beat one really tough enemy, finally beat him, died later on, and realized that I didn’t have to face him again. It is a nice touch and since the normal enemies still respawn, people can still farm for souls if they so desire.<br /><br /> The game’s bosses have also been improved, although I still don’t love them. Most of them no longer have cheap gimmicks to defeat them, but most of them still have health bars and damage outputs that are, in my personal opinion, way too high. Most people enjoyed Demon’s Souls’ boss fights a lot, so I am most likely in the minority, but it is how I feel. However, one of the coolest additions is the ability to summon NPC characters for certain boss fights. You have to be in human form to do this, but it is very worth it to use one of your rare humanities to get this experience. It makes the bosses easier and much fairer, and while some people will scowl at this thought, I had a blast defeating giant beasts with my allies, especially Solaire, who frequently appears throughout the game and is my favorite ally. The only downside to this is that if you died, you wasted your humanity and must find use another one. A minor complaint when you realize how cool the new feature is.<br /><br /> The game now has covenants for the player to join and while most of the features are for online play, there are still a few nifty features for offline play. For example, the hidden Chaos Servant covenant will reward players with new Pyromancy spells if they donate enough humanity. These aren’t a huge deal if you don’t plan to use all of the online features, but it is still satisfying to be part of a group.<br /><br /> I mentioned Pyromancy, another wonderful addition to the series. In order to use these types of spells, you must have a glove equipped and attunement slots to assign the spells. While this seems a lot like Miracles and Sorceries, it is awesome because there isn’t a Pyromancy stat; in order to further upgrade your spells, you upgrade your glove, which is treated like a weapon. This means that for melee builds, like myself, you still can use some spells. It can also make be a lifesaver when you encounter a strong enemy early on in the game, as fire is almost always effective against enemies. It isn’t forced on you, and probably not as necessary for most Faith and Magic builds, but I loved being able to swing my claymore at an enemy and them immediately switch to my glove to burn a Black Knight. Aside from the open world, this might be my favorite addition to the series.<br /><br /> Quick Note: there is no longer a tendency feature in the game. While I liked the idea and felt that it could’ve been improved upon, I suppose that scrapping it was a better choice than keeping it how it was.<br /><br /> Overall, the gameplay has been improved in some significant ways. It isn’t drastically different, but it is improved enough to where I didn’t feel like I was playing the same game over again. There are still some parts of the game that I don’t like, such as the lack of a pause mechanic, but those are most likely never going away. With that said, I loved the gameplay and it is definitely a reason to get the game.<br /><br />Story:<br /> I loved the lore in Demon’s Souls because it wasn’t complicated, yet still very interesting all at the same time. While the lore isn’t fully understandable and will most likely require some wiki searching, I’ve learned that that doesn’t make it any worse. It is actually fun to look up some of the missing pieces of the story and discuss them with others. There are also the significant lore ideas behind the ending. What seems like a standard ending in a video game is actually a complicated choice where you have to choose between one bad ending and another. It is complicated, but still an interesting lore to dig into.<br /><br />Design:<br /> Demon’s Souls had one of the best atmospheres in any game ever. For my first few hours with Dark Souls, I thought that there was no way it would reach those heights, yet I was (fortunately) proven otherwise. The game may not seem as gloomy and dark, but the atmosphere is still there. For example, the scene in which you first arrive in Anor Londo is breathtaking and a feast for the eyes; a truly marvelous sight to behold. The world design is also probably the best in any game because of the amount of shortcuts and interconnected feel of everything. You could travel to what seems like the other side of the map, and you’re still going to probably end up very close to a much earlier area. The interconnected feel of the game is awe-inspiring, but the game doesn’t lack in the atmosphere department either. Even though I may slightly prefer Demon’s Souls’ atmosphere, Dark Souls has some pretty rich areas, too. My personal favorite is Ash Lake, a hidden area and quite possibly the shortest area in the game. For being an area that could be completed in less than 10 minutes, it is still beautiful and evokes a strong emotional response from me. This atmosphere combined with the beautifully seamless world makes the overall design just as good as its predecessor.<br /><br />Sound:<br /> The sound is still mostly your footsteps and clashing weapons (which is oh-so satisfying when you hear it cut through your enemy’s flesh), but when the game does have music, it is still beautiful. The best example of this is probably during the last boss fight, where you hear a somber and quite tone as you attempt to decimate your foe. It is sad, yet uplifting at the same time, and another great theme starts with the end credits. Bravo to these composers, bravo! Magnificent is probably the best way to describe it as a whole.<br /><br />Difficulty:<br /> I feel that the game’s steep learning curve is inexcusable, but many people liked the last game because of all the sadistic parts. If you can get used to it and use a guide, then it isn’t that bad, but be warned: this game is not for the casual gamer who wants a fun and relaxing experience.<br /><br />Replay Value:<br /> The game’s replay value is surprisingly more than the last game’s, which is impressive considering how much time could be put into the other game. While I beat the previous game in about 45 hours, it took me roughly 60 hours to complete this game. There aren’t many games that can give you this much of a bargain for your buck, what with all of the classes, weapons, and spells to experiment with across different playthroughs and new game plus modes. This game can last you a very long time if you let it. Be careful to not be consumed by its addictive nature.<br /><br />Final Judgment:<br />This game is RECOMMENDED if you can handle it. If you liked Demon’s Souls, then you should like this game just as much, but if you couldn’t get into that game, this game probably won’t change your mind. What I feel like are the game’s weakest points are many fans’ favorites, which is a shame for me because I feel like the game is limiting its potential. Even with my complaints (which were, again, staples of the series), I still loved the experience, with the rich gameplay, deep lore, beautiful music, and phenomenal replay value and design. I recommend using a guide to get the most out of this game, but if you prefer to play it blindly, good for you. If you didn’t play the last game and are eager to try this out, you just might find a hidden gem.<br />FINAL SCORE= 9.25", "ParentASIN": "B0050SZ7IC", "Timestamp": 1461814732000, "ItemName": "Dark Souls Collector's Edition - Playstation 3", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.1, "RatingCount": 121, "Price": 219.99, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation 3", "Games"], "Description": "The game features a challenging dark fantasy world that rewards determined players.

There were differing opinions of whether or not the game’s artistic appeal and minimalistic story was worth the lack of gameplay and full story. The game, as a whole, received mostly positive reviews, with a score of 8.25/10 from me (4 stars). I enjoyed the atmosphere immensely, but thought that the gameplay and replay value was leaving much to be desired. Shadow of the Colossus, a spiritual successor to Ico, has rectified almost all of the problems that I originally had with Ico and not only continued with making a great atmospheric game, but also making it a fun game to play, with a lot more replay value than Ico. Shadow of the Colossus combines Ico’s artistic nature with the fun of video games to form a masterpiece.<br /><br />What This Game is All About:<br /> The game is a spiritual successor and prequel to Ico, but don’t let that trick you; the only noteworthy similarity, ignoring the ending (more on that later), is the atmosphere, which is still amazing. At the start of the game, you see your player character riding on a horse to a castle. When he arrives, he sets the body of a lifeless girl down (the relation is not stated). The castle is actually home to what seems to be a higher deity, and your character claims that this being has the power to resurrect people. The deity denies the request at first, but realizes that the character has an ancient sword, so it accepts. In order for the girl to be revived, Wander (the main character) must travel the Forbidden Land and defeat 16 colossi. Wander is warned that the price to be paid may be too high, but he accepts nonetheless. Thus, the adventure begins.<br /><br /> The premise of the entire game is very simple: you ride around on your horse, Agro, and look for the 16 colossi to vanquish. The ancient sword that you wield is able to shine a light in the sky that points toward the next colossi. You go there and do your best to defeat it. That is pretty much what main game is about.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /> The gameplay is unique in that the entire game is centered on boss fights. In order to defeat a colossus, Wander has to find its weak spots and stab them with the ancient sword. After enough stabs to the weak point(s), the colossus will fall and release black energy things (what they are is revealed at the end of the story). After awakening back at the castle, Wander continues the journey. What makes them really special, however, is that as you progress throughout the game, you begin to think of the colossi not so much as bosses, but as levels. Each colossus is a puzzle and you have to figure out how to beat it, with most colossi requiring you to find a way to reveal its weak points. Each colossus is different from the last and it doesn’t get boring because there are only 16. The sense of gratification from finally reaching a weak point and stabbing the colossus is amazing. Most of the time, the colossus will even try to shake you off and in order to stay alive, you must hold on to their fur. This adds another fun aspect to the game: stamina.<br /><br /> The stamina meter in this game is possibly the most important aspect in regards to defeating a colossus. The longer you hold on to a colossus and the more violently it shakes, the more the meter drains. The game is unlike a lot of games that automatically grab. You have to choose when to grab and when to release if you want to stay on top. It is a fun aspect that I greatly enjoyed.<br /><br /> When first starting the game, don’t let the controls sway you from not wanting to continue. I struggled with them for a while, but once I started to change them to my preferences in the options menu, I loved them. For example, Agro’s steering controls started out as awful, but once I changed the button that made him run to one of the back buttons, I was able to control the horse almost flawlessly because I could run, steer, and control the camera at the same time, with that last part making a huge difference. Even though the controls are finicky in the beginning, they can be improved with some adjustments.<br /><br /> While someone’s favorite colossus will vary greatly from person to person, I shall describe my favorite in order to give you the sense of sheer awesomeness that I was feeling. My favorite was the 5th colossus, which is a giant bird-like creature. By shooting an arrow at it, you attract its attention. When the bird is flying towards you, you have to jump at the right time and grab on to its wings. The rest of the battle is phenomenal, as you are flying through the sky as the bird is twisting and turning, trying to throw you off. In order to vanquish it, you must stab its wings until it is no more. Once you defeat it, you fall into the water below.<br /><br /> I’ve described almost all of the aspects of the gameplay and although it may not seem like a lot, it really doesn’t matter, because the less is more approach made the game incredibly fun. This alone makes the game, in my opinion, far superior than Ico, as I found the game fun to play. Unlike that game, where the design was the only strong reason to play, this game also has fun gameplay. Nothing beats the feeling you get after making the final blow to that final colossus (I won’t bother describing it, as the presentation alone is wonderful).<br /><br />Story:<br /> In my review of Ico, I said that minimal amount of story was good because of the end, but because of the lack of any story in-between, it wasn’t all that spectacular. While this game still lacks a lot of story for the middle part of the game, I felt that this game’s ending was a lot more satisfying and made the journey worth it, from a story perspective. It is great for people who haven’t played Ico because it sets its own story, but it also has some aspects that draw from that game’s story, too. The end credits scene, specifically, shows the 2 games’ relationship, and it adds room for those who want to speculate without ruining it for other people. It is bittersweet, and I wasn’t sure whether or not I should feel happy or sad. It was a wonderful moment and I liked it a whole lot more than Ico’s ending and I think that it deserves a spot on one of the greatest video game endings ever and it most definitely reaches the level of classic books and movies.<br /><br />Design:<br /> Just like Ico, the game has wonderful atmosphere, but I think it is ever so slightly better because the game has more story. The sense of loneliness and despair as you travel throughout the land is awe-inspiring. There is also a great deal of sadness whenever you slay one of the beasts, as most of them don’t even attack you until you attack them, and some don’t even attack you at all. Not only are you absorbing the colossi’s black energy swirls (which seems to weaken Wander), but you are also destroying mostly peaceful beasts. Was it really worth it? Are you a monster yourself? When a game makes me think this way, you know that it is something special.<br /><br />Sound:<br /> The sound in the game is also amazing, and it addresses one of the complaints that I had with Ico, which was that it was just a little too silent. This game only has music when you are fighting the colossi, so you get the sense of loneliness when traversing the land and the epic music when taking down a colossus. You get the best of both worlds.<br /><br />Difficulty:<br /> The game’s difficulty is fine. It isn’t too hard and the puzzles are mostly solvable without too much trouble, once you get the hang of it. Once you complete the game, there are optional Time Attack and Hard modes, so those are there for those who want an extra challenge. Speaking of Time Attack…<br /><br />Replay Value:<br /> The Time Attack mode gives this game more replay value not only by having you try to beat record times, but because for every 2 colossus times that you beat, you get a new item, and these items are different for both normal and hard. The items aren’t the greatest unlockables ever, but they are still a nice treat. There are also Lizard Tails and Fruit to collect, but I barely encountered any, but I guess if you want to look for them, more power to you. The game also has a secret area, which is only accessible by maxing out Wander’s stamina bar, which can be done by collecting the tails or beating the colossus in consecutive new game plus modes. It took me about 10 hours to complete the game, so even if you continue the new game plus modes, it isn’t the longest lasting game, but it is more than worthy of replays anyway.<br /><br />Final Judgment:<br />This game is RECOMMENDED. It has almost everything that a game needs in order to be considered a masterpiece, with no major flaws that are apparent. What this game accomplishes most, however, is the fact that it doesn’t separate the art fans and video game fans like Ico; it combines them and should please them both. It truly is the next step for video games to be considered more than just button mashers (no disrespect intended toward fighting games).

Most of the game is the same as the PS2 version, but there are some slight differences.<br /><br />The debate that has been going on for years: are video games art? If they aren’t art now, will they ever be? No matter whose side you are on in this is heated discussion, it cannot be denied that some games have a certain appeal that can really connect with an audience. While games like Mario are mostly designed for gameplay purposes, some games give gameplay secondary importance, behind the artistic style of the game. Ico is one of these games. Does a game where the gameplay isn’t the vital component work? It has its moments, but I don’t think that it succeeds on the entire scale.<br /><br />What This Game is All About:<br /> This game is very mysterious. There is barely any explanation throughout the entire game for almost everything. However, there are still some bits and pieces that are inferred and that can be explained after watching the opening and playing for a little. At its core, Ico is an escort game, a puzzle game, and most importantly, a game with a heavy focus on the atmosphere and style.<br />The game starts out with men on horseback taking a young boy to a castle and locking him up there. It isn’t explained why in great depth as to why he must be locked up, but it is notable that the boy does have horns coming out of his head. The men say tell the boy to not be angry, as locking him up is for the good of the village. My presumption is that he is some sort of sacrifice because he has horns. The men then leave and what seems like an earthquake shakes the castle. Ico, which I’m guessing is the boy’s name, is able to escape because of this. After exploring for a few minutes, he encounters a girl locked up in a cage. They don’t speak each other’s languages, but he decides to help free her. Once he does, mysterious shadow creatures come and attempt to take her. With the help of a stick, Ico fights them back. Even though they don’t understand each other, Ico decides that he will try his best to help them both escape. The game is basically you escorting this girl around and solving puzzles to get out of the castle, all while avoiding the shadow creatures. It is a simple premise, but effective nonetheless. On to the gameplay!<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /> As previously stated, the game is a puzzle game. Ico escorts Yorda throughout the castle and has to solve puzzles to continue on their way. Yorda also has some mystical powers that she can use to open certain doors, so the player can’t just ditch her and be on his or her way. While the puzzles can be relaxing, the game doesn’t seem to be polished enough to warrant being considered great gameplay.<br /><br /> The first problem is that the puzzles aren’t explained well enough. Puzzles are meant to be strenuous on the mind, yes, but the game doesn’t tell you what the limits or parameters of the game are. For example, during one part of the game, I was on a chain and just knew that swinging with it would help me. However, I didn’t know how to, so I just figured that that wasn’t the correct way to go about that particular puzzle. Eventually, I found out that by holding the action button and using the analog stick, I could swing. While that situation isn’t entirely the game’s fault, it is situations like that that make me question what I am supposed to do in certain situations. While it may have been the developer’s intentions to make the player think outside of the box, that doesn’t always work in a video game when you, the player, don’t know your own limits. As I progressed through the game, this problem became miniscule because I started to know my own limitations, but at first, it was tricky to figure out what they were.<br /><br /> The game isn’t heavy on combat, but it does have the shadow creatures that must be dispensed every now and then. There are 2 ways of doing this, the first being good ole fashioned combat, and the second being reaching one of Yorda’s doors, where she will eliminate all of them in that area (these doors are also checkpoints). At first, I thought that having those 2 options every time those creatures showed up would be cool, giving the player the choice or running with Yorda to the exit or staying to defend themselves. Unfortunately, the second option isn’t usually an option, making the player fight them. This wouldn’t be bad, if the combat was good. The combat is just awful. Your starting weapon, that stick, is too underpowered and it is hard to hit enemies because of how Ico attacks (there is no lock-on mechanic). Once you progress through the game a decent bit and receive the sword, this problem isn’t nearly as bad, but it was frustrating at first because of the time it took to vanquish the enemies. If Yorda does happen to get grabbed by them, they’ll take her to a black hole, where you’ll have a short period of time to reach out and grab her hand, saving her. This time limit to reach her was actually a fair amount, so kudos to the developer for making that part less frustrating.<br /><br /> This is a puzzle game with combat interspersed every now and then. It is a shame, then, that the checkpoints can be frustrating. It is not that they’re necessarily placed in bad locations, but more of the fact that you can spend 5 minutes fighting enemies and then start a puzzle, only to die because of a poor jump, meaning that you’ll have to do it all over again. It is usually the other way around, which is a lot worse because you just spent x amount of time solving a puzzle, only to be ambushed by those rude creatures. Again, this gets better once the sword is acquired, but it is annoying during the beginning areas of the game.<br /><br /> As far as the puzzles themselves, once you start knowing what the game is expecting of you, in terms of limitations, they are pretty fun. They aren’t the best puzzles in the world, but they are relaxing to complete, until a shadow creature pops up, and then you proceed to moan. The gameplay isn’t special, but it isn’t that bad either. I suppose that you could say it is above average for the relaxing puzzle experience and the enemy encounters once you get a better weapon. If you only play games with exceptional gameplay, then don’t even bother with the rest of this review, because this is just above mediocre.<br /><br />Story:<br /> The game doesn’t have much of a story, per se, but I think that is the point. After those opening moments, there is a brief scene a little later that elaborates a little more, but things don’t really pick up until the end. I think that the player is supposed to develop an attraction with Yorda throughout, since they are together throughout the entire game, but I feel that there should be at least a little story in order to feel this connection. There wasn’t virtually any, until the end. I liked the ending a little bit, but I didn’t love it, because it felt very predictable. That is what I originally thought, until the credits finished rolling. The continued ending makes the player think, which I suppose is good. It is a very subtle story, one that doesn’t always work, but in the end, the game accomplished at least some of its goal.<br /><br />Design:<br /> This is where the game truly shines. The design and atmosphere is wonderful and by far, my absolute favorite aspect of the game and is why I continued to play it. As you progress, you start to see parts of the castle that you’ve already been to and sometimes you end up back at an old place without even realizing that that was where you were headed. The interconnected feeling of the castle, coupled with the game’s beautiful aesthetic appeal, makes the game a gorgeous treat for the eyes. The lighting is particularly worthy of its own praise. There were a couple moments during the game where I was walking along a long bridge with Yorda, and the sun caught my eye. The effect was so well made that I actually lifted my hand to cover my eye. That is when you know that a game has succeeded with atmosphere and lighting to almost perfection.<br /><br />Sound:<br /> The sound effects work nicely with the game. The footsteps as you walk on the rough castle surface, the birds flapping through the wind, and the amazing music during select moments of the game. The only problem that I have (and mind you, this is very minor) is that there isn’t quite enough music. I understand that the game is supposed to give you a feeling of loneliness, but just a tiny bit more would’ve really nailed the experience for me. Still, it is fantastic in this regard.<br /><br />Difficulty:<br /> The game’s difficulty works mostly well. There were the checkpoint problems mentioned above and the game’s lack of explanation at the beginning, but overall, the difficulty still works rather well. It was a good balance.<br /><br />Replay Value:<br /> The game’s replay value is nonexistent. You can beat it in about 8 hours on your first playthrough, but there is virtually no reason to replay it. You can get one additional secret weapon in this mode and Yorda’s subtitles are translated, but that is it. Personally, I feel that translating the subtitles ruins a major point of the game: communication and friendship without words. Also, because of the story’s minimalistic approach, the only reason to replay it would be to see the ending. There aren’t any moments during the middle of the game that are worth replaying for. Every notable event is in the beginning or end. A rent would probably be best for this game.<br /><br />Final Judgment:<br />This is not a game designed with a heavy focus on gameplay or lasting appeal. While the ending makes you think, the replay value is not there. The story has its moments, but there isn’t any reason to revisit it. If, however, you want to play a truly immersive game that fights for the argument of “video games are art,” then this game is wholeheartedly recommended. Otherwise, pass it on. This game is SOMETIMES RECOMMENDED.<br />FINAL SCORE= 8.25", "ParentASIN": "B00004YUWA", "Timestamp": 1460419844000, "ItemName": "Ico - PlayStation 2", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.5, "RatingCount": 267, "Price": 37.0, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Value Games Under $20"], "Description": "Sure! Please provide the text you'd like me to summarize."}, {"Rating": 5.0, "Title": "Master the Soul Arts", "Content": "When video games were first becoming really popular during the NES-era, they were difficult to beat. Most games weren’t beaten during those days, with games like The Legend of Zelda, which was almost impossible without a guide, and Super Mario Bros. 3, which suffered from the lack of a save mechanic with its original debut, having their endings unseen by most players. But during those simpler times, the experience of simply playing the game was enough, not attempting to fully complete it. Demon’s Souls harkens back to this time with a more difficult, in a way, game that has a deep focus on gameplay. Does this work? For the most part, it works, but it isn’t perfect.<br /><br />What This Game is All About:<br /> You play as a self-created character, done at the beginning with a simple character creator (nothing elaborate), and you proceed through a medieval setting defeating enemies and progressing through levels from a hub world. By defeating enemies, you gain souls, the equivalent of money and XP in this game. The catch is that if you die, you lose all of the unused souls, and you leave a bloodstain where you died. You have one chance to reclaim them. If you don’t, they are gone forever. The game also has an array of weapons, armors and outfits, and spells at the player’s disposal. It seems simple from reading this, but all of this combined turns it into a complicated game that requires dedication and time to fully comprehend.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /> There are 2 main ways of combating enemies; the first is done through close-up melee combat and the second is done through spells of 2 different types. The melee combat is one of the best features in the game, as it is based on when and how you attack your enemies. If your enemy is about to hit you with his sword, don’t go in for the attack, because you’ll end up getting hit and losing chunks of your health as you get repeatedly slashed because you left an opening. You could try dodging with a quick roll, the speed being determined by how much weight your character is carrying, and then stab him in the back with a critical hit. The basic combat of dodge-attack-dodge turns into a fully realized way of fighting that is the center to this game. Alternatively, you could be a magic-based character and use spells from a distance. I highly recommend not doing this unless you are at an exceptionally difficult part, as it takes away most of the fun from this game. Melee combat is required no matter how you build your character, but the magic-based class(es) seem greatly overpowered, but that could be a good way to start the game and get introduced to the mechanics. Still, I recommend using melee most of the time for direct combat.<br /><br /> The game has deep upgrade system for both your characters and the weapons you acquire. The character is leveled up with souls, but unlike most games, it is unwise to balance out your character. The enemies get stronger throughout the game, and as the cultural phrase goes, a jack of all trades is a master of none. After experimenting a little, set your sights on 2-4 stats out of 8 and go all out. After I put a decent amount of hours into the game, I restarted and was able to get to my previous point in about ¼ of the time because I knew what I was doing (more on the learning curve in a bit) and I knew how to upgrade. It does make a drastic difference with how you upgrade your character at the beginning..<br /><br /> The weapon upgrades has its pros and cons, but I did like it. You can find different materials to upgrade your weapon, and each one does something different. For example, you could use the basic materials to give the weapon definitive stats throughout the playthrough, or you could use a different material that has the weapons stats scale with how many stat points you have in Strength. There are 14 different materials, from Dexterity scaling (for quicker weapons) to Magic (if you prefer spells, but want to get up close) to flame-based (it doesn’t scale with a particular stat, but it does deal immense amounts of damage to flesh enemies) and many more. The biggest problem with this system is how rare it is to get certain materials. There are 3 or 4 different types of each material, and as you continue upgrading the weapon, you need to start getting the rarer materials and more of the common ones. This seems fair, but some of them are completely luck-based with how you find them, and increasing the luck stat does not increase your chances (it just increases the percentage of items dropped, not the rarity). On top of that, if you do find the needed materials to upgrade your weapon, but later decide to switch weapons, you completely wasted those. You shouldn’t get an unlimited amount of these, but it would be a lot better if it they were more common, so that you could upgrade more often and with less frustration from not getting lucky.<br /><br /> The game also includes a good/bad system that determines some small events in the game. With White tendency, which is good, you can gain access to special areas and get rare equipment. With Black tendency, you face harder enemies, but you can get rarer items. This is a great idea, but it was poorly implemented. Unless you use a guide, you have no idea what to do to get certain tendency, and they separate your character tendency from the tendency in that particular world. It is needlessly complicated and not worth the time unless you desperately want a specific weapon or all of the in-game trophies.<br /><br /> There is also the problem of the game’s bosses, or Demons. While these are supposed to be the highlight of the game, I found them very disappointing. They aren’t hard in the sense that you must use skill and cunning strategies to overcome them, but rather suffer through their insane amounts of health that make the battles longer than they need to be. Also, they do way too much damage. I understand that the bosses are supposed to be powerful Demons, but having over half of your health go away from one attack isn’t fair, because you could be do everything almost perfectly, but get hit once or twice and have to restart the entire battle because of the boss’s overpowered attacks and the repetitiveness of the battle, due to how much health they have. They’re not all cheap in a hard way; some are cheap in an easy way, where you can stand from afar and just snipe the boss until their health is all gone (this is where Magic makes the game even easier, and at least arrows don’t replenish). Some battles are better than others, but they are definitely lackluster. Each boss also gives you a Demon Souls, which you can use to get a special weapon or spell. I advise you to save these and not just use them to upgrade your character, since there is only 1 of each per playthrough.<br /><br /> The game has no pause mechanic. This is just an awful decision. They probably didn’t include it because you could use various methods to get out of hard situation, like looking something up online when you are being attacked by a new monster, but if I have to go somewhere, like the bathroom, then I want to be able to pause. I didn’t have many problems, but this would be a huge problem for a family gamer. It wasn’t a very good decision.<br /><br /> I know that I listed more complaints than I did positive aspects, but the gameplay is still solid. I am just preparing potential players for the bad, because there is bad, but the basics of the gameplay (the combat and upgrades) are by far the best. There is too much farming needed for certain items, the tendency system isn’t implemented very well, the bosses are disappointing, and the lack of a pause button is inexcusable, but these are nitpicks in a game where I greatly enjoyed the tense fight encounters with normal enemies and the upgrading system when I finally figured out what I was doing.<br /><br />Story:<br /> The game gives you an intro after the first level, but most of the story is lore, and I love it. You can talk to a character and learn where they came from, why the place that you are in is the way it is, or how the level Demon came to be. It isn’t as deep as something like The Elder Scrolls (although I haven’t played much of those games), but I love it the way it is. It allows me to be immersed with these characters, without having to go online to read ten pages of biography. It is simple, to the point, and very interesting.<br /><br />Design:<br /> I have not been this impressed with a game’s atmosphere since Shadow of the Colossus. It is dark, eerie, tense, scary, and every other emotion that you can get from a game. The first world is set in the middle of a fallen kingdom, while the second is set in underground tunnels with miners and lava bugs. The third world is, to me, the scariest and is set in a prison and later high up with flying gargoyles. The fourth world has flying monsters that shoot at you, along with skilled skeletons and reapers that summon enemies to attack you. The fifth world is a disgusting place filled with some of the most hideous monsters in the game, but it has feeling. Whether or not you like the design of the levels, which I do, they give you feelings and make you gaze at their beauty, even if they are horrific. This is where the game shines and it is what first got me interested to review this game. It has met and surpassed my expectations by far.<br /><br />Sound:<br /> The game has very little music, with it trying to give you the feeling of loneliness that is part of the atmosphere, but when there is music (during the opening, for instance), it is sad, yet well-composed. The sound effects are also great, with the little noises, such as the sound of your armor when you roll, having a profound effect. Then, there is the sound when sword and shields collide, or when your axe cuts through the flesh of your enemy. They are fantastically depicted in this game.<br /><br />Difficulty:<br /> This is the reason that the game doesn’t get a higher score from me. The bosses’ health bars should have been drastically reduced, along with their damage output, and there should’ve been midlevel checkpoints. The game has fog gates that signify a new area and those would’ve been the perfect opportunity to incorporate checkpoints. There is also the fact that you lose all of your souls when you die. I don’t care how some people say otherwise, but losing all of those when you die does not make the game any harder whatsoever; it just makes the game repetitive when you have to repeat what you’ve already done. This is called artificial difficulty, for those of you who don’t know. Some will claim that this creates tension, but then you have artificial tension. There are other ways of teaching the player their mistakes when they die, other than stripping them of their hard-earned souls.<br /><br /> The game even has an awful learning curve. The first level was by far the hardest level in the game for me. Without an online guide, I would’ve been completely lost. I get it, some people like to figure out everything for themselves and call themselves hardcore, but a little explanation here and there wouldn’t hurt. It gave me the button commands and plopped me into the game. Once you get used to everything, it isn’t that bad, but my goodness, it was unfair at the beginning.<br /><br />Replay Value:<br /> The game has a lot of replay value, with an infinite amount of New Game Plus modes, and the gaining of new equipment and upgrades throughout each consecutive playthrough continues to excite me. The game also makes you want to start a new game, to try out different approaches. I am very eager to try out a magic character with past situations. The game can last a very long time, and has a Pokémon-like addiction to it.<br /><br />Final Judgment:<br />If you can get your hands on a guide, especially for the beginning, or enjoy torture, then I RECOMMEND this game. There are a few nitpicks here and there, but the combat is deep, the lore is interesting and not a chore to dig through, the sound is exceptional, and the atmosphere and replay value are amazing. Go buy it, suffer through the first few hours, and then have fun.<br />FINAL SCORE= 9.25", "ParentASIN": "B002KAS4OW", "Timestamp": 1460419593000, "ItemName": "Demon's Souls - PS3 [Digital Code]", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.8, "RatingCount": 2529, "Price": null, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation 3", "Games"], "Description": "The game merges action and RPG elements, allowing players to engage in combat and magic while offering extensive multiplayer features that enhance the single-player experience.

In 2007, they released a collection called the Orange Box. It contained Half-Life 2, along with both of its add-on DLCs, Team Fortress 2, and a new game called Portal. This review will be focused on the last and most unknown of these. Although it won’t be the main selling point of the collection, Portal is one of the most innovative games of this generation and is worthy of being hailed as one of Valve’s, and therefore, gaming’s best games.<br /><br />What This Game is All About:<br /> The main player character is Chell, a silent female protagonist, much like Gordon Freeman. She has no characterization, which is a disappointment, but some players may feel more immersed by this. The only other character in the game is GLaDOS, the Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System. This character is funny, sarcastic, malicious, intelligent, and a joy to hear throughout the game, but more on that later and why she is one of gaming’s finest characters.<br /><br /> The game has Chell use a portal gun to shoot portals out, whereby entering one, she comes out of the other. This seems like an extremely simple premise, but it quickly turns into an addicting puzzle game that slowly increases the challenge as you continue through each test chamber. Combine this exceptional gameplay with GLaDOS’s perfect dialogue, and you get Portal.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /> The game is composed of 20 Test Chambers that Chell must navigate through with the help of the Portal gun. As the game is started, it seems like she is just a test subject, but throughout the game, GLaDOS slowly starts to reveal hidden intentions. What starts out as a fun puzzle game with a unique gun quickly turns into an amazing game outright that has you shooting portals to avoid falling to your doom in goo, avoid getting smashed, and destroying military turrets. The game is very short, taking about 3 hours, give or take. However, it is some of the best 3 hours somebody could ask for in a game. I won’t say much more about the gameplay, in order to surprise the gamer with its cool puzzles, but know that it is addicting and fun, worthy of being a full-fledged game.<br /><br />Story:<br /> The game, as previously stated, has Chell navigate through the Aperture Science test chambers, but the game slowly starts to reveal GLaDOS’s hidden intentions. The story isn’t anything Oscar worthy by itself, but GLaDOS alone is worthy of being considered one of the best video game villains ever created. She is very reminiscent of Hal, but different in her own way. She starts out helping the player, but is also very sarcastic. As the player starts avoiding traps that were seemingly meant to kill her, you can hear the sarcastic congratulations she starts to give with her demonic and computerized voice. Chell is a silent protagonist, but GLaDOS more than makes up for it. The game also features some hidden rooms that show carvings on the wall, with phrases such as “The cake is a lie.” The rooms are very disturbing and add a lot to the game, especially with the foreshadowing. Also, the game features one of the saddest deaths in all of gaming. Just be prepared to cry.<br /><br />Design:<br /> The levels are relatively bland, being mostly white and black layers, but the puzzles are very unique in their designs. It is very gratifying to complete a puzzle, even if it was a simple one. The first 14 or so are very short and not very hard, but the pace picks up with the last 6 or so. If the player discovers the previously mentioned hidden rooms, it adds a lot to the game’s atmosphere. After completing the game, that one phrase adds so much more to the game.<br /><br />Sound:<br /> There isn’t much music, aside from some hidden rooms with radios, but the sound effects are crafted together very well. The voice acting of GLaDOS is also top notch. The game also features the best credits sequence in any game…ever.<br /><br />Difficulty:<br /> The game is, in my opinion, an almost perfect difficulty with a very smooth learning curve that continuously increases the challenge of each level. After completing the game, some levels may be selected to complete it with certain restraints (least steps, least portals, etc.), but I was perfectly happy with playing it the normal way.<br /><br />Replay Value:<br /> The biggest downfall of the game is that it is too short. I beat it in about 3 hours. If the game is bought with the Orange Box, then it is of course an amazing deal, but by itself, it just might not be worth a buy, even if it is quite possibly this generation’s finest moment in gaming. There is, however, some developer commentary for those who like those extras, plus it is more than worthy of a replay.<br /><br />Final Judgment:<br />Only the replay value is a valid reason for not buying this game. I fully recommend getting the Orange Box version, or at least renting this to enjoy it at least one time. The gameplay is innovative, GLaDOS is entertainingly evil, and the learning curve is near-perfect.

The first game helped to define the genre known as Metroidvania (Metroid and Castlevania). The third entry in the series, Super Metroid, received exceptionally high reviews, with critics lauding the exploration, hidden items, sense of isolation, bosses, and the ending, which is still one of my favorite endings in any video game. With all of the success that the series had, why would Nintendo skip over the entire Nintendo 64 generation, aside from Samus’s appearance in Super Smash Bros? Not only did they wait 8 years to release another Metroid game, but it was licensed to a then unknown North American developer, Retro Studios. To add even more confusion, they changed the gameplay from a 2D sidescroller to a first-person perspective. Was this the right decision for Nintendo? It was one of their best decisions.<br /><br />What This Game is All About:<br /> The game is played from Samus Aran’s first-person perspective, an intergalactic bounty hunter with a very powerful Power Suit. The prologue has Samus receiving a distress signal from the Space Frigate Orpheon. So, Samus takes her spaceship and heads over to see what has happened. After exploring the frigate and defeating a mutated alien, the frigate starts a destruction timer, and Samus must escape. As Samus is escaping, she encounters Ridley, her arch-nemesis and the leader of the Space Pirates. Once Samus does escape, she lands on the nearby planet, Tallon IV. Unfortunately, she has lost all of her upgrades because of the explosion. This is a unique gameplay aspect: having the player start with roughly half of the upgrades, only to lose them right away. It gives the player a nice tease for what is to come.<br /><br /> The rest of the game has Samus exploring various areas of Tallon IV to uncover the Space Pirates plans and stop it, along with uncovering the mysterious secrets of the Chozo civilization that once lived here. It is a great premise and one that really pumps up the player to start the grand adventure.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /> The transition from a 2D perspective to a first-person perspective is phenomenal. You get to see everything from Samus’s point-of-view, from the onslaught of enemies to the water dripping off of her after coming above water. It is a truly immersive experience that helps to add depth to the gameplay.<br /><br /> The controls are fantastic, with the player using various buttons to activate weapons, a morph ball, and more. The game has The Legend of Zelda’s trademark lock-on feature, which greatly helps the player when combating enemies. The Wii remote is used to aim, which is surprisingly well done. I still prefer dual-analog controls ever so slightly, but these are still remarkable and probably the best in any Wii game. Since the original Gamecube version didn’t use dual-analog controls, this is a great improvement.<br /><br /> The game is all about exploration, with Samus having to attain certain upgrades for her Power Suit in order to gain access to new areas in the game. The sense of accomplishment from finding a brand new suit, to just a small missile expansion pack is immensely rewarding, rivaling that of the Zelda series item finding. The player can find suit upgrades, different beams for the Arm Cannon, Energy Tanks to increase the maximum health, missile expansions, Power Bomb expansions, and still more. The game has a total of 100 different items for the player to collect, and it is a great satisfaction to get more and more.<br /><br /> The action in this game is intense and frightening, with different alien species trying to kill Samus, along with the evil Space Pirates. The Space Pirates in particular are very intelligent and try to not only dodge Samus, but also to team up and corner her, making every encounter drive you to the edge of your seat. Sometimes, the enemies get repetitive when re-exploring the same areas, but it is also fun to try out the new toys on them.<br /><br /> One of the game’s slight problems is backtracking, which there is a lot of. Granted, I had to encounter more than the average player because I would go to the nearest save point every time that I got an item, but it was still a lot. There are elevators spread out the areas, but a fast travel feature would’ve been nice.<br /><br /> The game also has one of gaming’s worst gameplay types: first-person platforming. This is just awful, and the main reason that this game doesn’t get a slightly higher score. It just isn’t fun, mainly because it is hard to judge where you are jumping. It gets slightly better when Samus receives the double jump, but it is still annoying.<br /><br /> The game also has a unique scanning feature, where the player can scan enemies and the environment to learn more about them. These are all recorded in a logbook in the pause menu. This is a great addition, especially when scanning bosses to try to uncover their secrets. I got a little bit sick of it by the time that I finished the game, but the logbooks carry over to a new game, so I won’t have to scan everything again. This was a small, but very pleasing addition to the Wii version.<br /><br /> Speaking of bosses, the bosses in this game are some of my favorite. There’s a giant alien on the frigate, a giant and poisonous plant with large tentacles, an elite Space Pirate, along with the epic battle with Mecha Ridley, which is one of my favorite battles in any video game, and still more. The game did a fantastic job of building up the hype to face Ridley, with Samus sometimes seeing him fly throughout the sky in one of the game’s cutscenes. Each boss has weaknesses that the player must uncover, and the scanning visor makes this very fun. It helps enough, but doesn’t spoil too much.<br /><br /> The gameplay isn’t perfect, with platforming and backtracking elements being slightly annoying, but nothing beats the satisfaction of fully-upgrading Samus and pummeling old enemies and unlocking new areas. The gameplay is truly remarkable in this game, and quite possibly the best use of the Wii’s motion controls.<br /><br />Story:<br /> The game has a way of telling the story that is very different from most video games. In order to actually know what is going on in the game, the player must scan certain areas in the environment. These could be a Space Pirate log, showing the player their plans on Tallon IV, or an ancient Chozo glyph that explains their past civilization and why they are no longer here. There isn’t much of a conventional narrative, but uncovering these logs and glyphs were some of my favorite parts in the game. I love great narratives in my games, but I loved the way that Retro Studios implemented the story into scans. Players who don’t scan often are missing out.<br /><br />Design:<br /> This game has probably the best atmosphere in any game ever created. As soon as I landed on Tallon IV, I knew that I was in for a treat. For a game created in 2002, the graphics have held up amazingly. The game still looks gorgeous to this day. The water soaking off of Samus’s visor, the reflection of her eyes in certain scenarios, and the game’s beautiful in-game engine cutscenes are fantastic to look at. Retro Studios made a great decision in keeping the cutscenes in 3rd-person, and then quickly reverting back to first-person for the gameplay. You can’t really describe great atmosphere, but this game is the best of the best.<br /><br />Sound:<br /> To complement a great atmosphere, the game includes one of gaming’s greatest soundtracks. Each area has a different vibe to it, and the music is very pleasing to the ears. The music is also one of gaming’s best, and you can unlock them at the main menu to listen to whenever the player chooses so. Great music complements a great atmosphere.<br /><br />Difficulty:<br /> The difficulty is almost perfect. It isn’t too easy or hard. If the player does get stuck, they could always go exploring for better upgrades. The game also includes a hint system that can be toggled on and off. I only died twice during the game, but I never felt like my hand was being held. It was a balanced difficulty, and there are harder options for those who want it, although they are completely optional.<br /><br />Replay Value:<br /> The game took me about 25 hours to complete and it was amazing. The game also carries over the third game’s credit system to unlock pieces of artwork and musical themes at the main menu. The real reason for replaying the game, however, is just because it is so fun. Although the Metroid games are known for their speed runs, I would never want to run through this game, especially with how immersive it was.<br /><br />Final Judgment:<br />Only a few nitpicks keep this game from a max rating. It is, by far, one of my favorite video game experiences ever. The Wii version is the first version that I played of this, and aside from graphics, which aren’t terrible by any means and still look great, it could be played as if it was a new game. It is an amazing game and very RECOMMENDED. Go buy it.

The collection itself is great.<br />The Mario series is considered to be one of the greatest video game series of all time, with many claiming it as the pinnacle of gaming achievement. The main series is composed of 2D and 3D platform games, with Super Mario Bros. 3 (released for the Famicom/NES in 1988) and Super Mario World (released for the Super Famicom/SNES in 1990) considered to be the best that the 2D series has to offer. So, which one of these games is the best? Is it the revolutionary 3rd game that has defined Mario for years to come, or is it the refined and polished 4th entry in the series? The battle has begun!<br /><br />What These Games Are All About:<br /> Everybody knows the story of the Mario series; Bowser kidnaps the princess and it is up to Mario and Luigi (in multiplayer) to save the day. In the 3rd game, the player travels throughout the Mushroom Kingdom, while the 4th game has them travel throughout Dinosaur Island. This is a very basic plot, but the plot didn’t sell these games or earn them critical acclaim. The games also had stunning graphics for the time period that they were released, alongside amazing and catchy soundtracks. Because these 2 features are both great in their respective games, they tend to be hard to rank without giving a subjective opinion. With that being stated, the gameplay will be the core focus of this article.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /> There is no doubt that the original Super Mario Bros. game was fantastic, but it is amazing at how much was improved for the 3rd and 4th games (the 2nd game was mostly the same in Japan, while it was barely a Mario game in the U.S.). The third game showed that Mario could now pick up shells and release them to send them zooming forward to take out enemies and destroy nearby bricks. World even allowed Mario to throw the shell straight upwards, and the game added a spin jump to do extra damage to enemies. These are each small improvements, but Mario really shines with level designs. Both of the games had excellent levels that were very fun, but the real difference between the games were the power-ups.<br /><br />Power-Ups:<br /> 3 had roughly 10 power-ups in the game, with the Super Mushroom, Star, and Fire Flower returning. The game’s most famous addition is probably the Leaf power-up, which transformed Mario into Raccoon Mario. This let Mario do a spin attack with his tail, float down onto platforms, and even fly for a short period of time if he got a running start. There were 2 variations of this outfit, the P-Wing, which let him fly over one entire level, and the Tanooki Suit, with allowed Mario to turn into an invincible statue that could slam down on enemies. The game also had a Frog Suit that let Mario swim easier and faster underwater, but at the cost of decreased land movement. There was also the Hammer Suit, which allowed Mario to become one of his most hated enemies, the Hammer Bros. One level in the game even allowed Mario to go into a shoe and walk over obstacles and enemies that would normally kill him. All of these were fantastic power-ups that helped spice things up from the original. The overworld map even had Toad Houses that contained a power-up for the player to find. While World did improve the overworld map by making all the worlds combined into one seamless island, it didn’t contain the Toad Houses, probably because of the fewer number of power-ups.<br /><br /> World got rid of all of the new power-ups, keeping only the original 3. The replacements were the Cape Feather and Yoshi, the dinosaur. The Cape Feather was a substitute for the Raccoon Leaf. It also allowed Mario to glide and fly, although this was more difficult because the player had to alternate button presses to stay airborne. The problem with this is that it was difficult at first, but once it was mastered, the player could skip entire levels just by tapping a couple of buttons quickly. This ruined some of the fun aspect, although it was entirely optional, so it wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. Mario could also slam down onto the ground to take out enemies, and do a spin attack. Yoshi, however, was completely different. Mario could ride him and use his tongue to suck up enemies, even allowing him to spit out Koopa shells. If Yoshi sucked up certain shell colors, he gained new moves: fire breath, flight, and a ground pound. These were great additions and really made Yoshi a memorable transportation device. If Mario was hit while riding Yoshi, the dinosaur would scamper off, but he could be caught again if the player was quick. This did make it easier to maintain Yoshi, unlike in 3, where some of the power-ups were rarer.<br /><br /> Even though both of the games had great abilities, the 3rd game had a better selection of power-ups with a greater variety. The Cape was fun, but it was just an alternate Raccoon Suit. Yoshi is probably gaming’s greatest dinosaur, and he is also a lot more common and easier to obtain than some of the powers in the 3rd game, but he just didn’t replace the sheer variety that 3 had to offer.<br /><br />Worlds:<br /> Both games had fantastic levels, but there were some noticeable differences between them. The 3rd game had approximately 90 levels spread across 8 worlds, but unlike in World, these levels were shorter and more difficult. World had approximately 70 levels, but some contained multiple exits, totaling 96. To make up for the longer length, the game added a checkpoint gate. Neither of these elements are necessarily better than the other, but World also added a save system. At first glance, this might seem to be an automatic win for World, but 3 had Warp Whistles, which allowed the player to warp to another world. This wasn’t as great as saving, but it was an excellent substitute if the player could find them.<br /><br /> The games both had fun worlds, with 3 having 2 particularly memorable worlds: 4 and 8. World 4 was Giant Land, where all of the blocks and Mario’s enemies were much larger than the standard versions, but were still defeated the same way. Although it didn’t change the gameplay, it was a fun and unique aesthetic. World 8 was also Bowser’s Dark World, where Mario had to traverse over his entire army of tanks and battleships. Although some players claim that it is too hard and repetitive, a fair statement, it is a very climactic end to the game, and really emphasizes Bowser’s power.<br /><br /> World had some unique worlds, too, with the Forest of Illusion being a perfect example. The levels seemed normal at first, but the overhead map was a different story. Sometimes, completing the level would create a path right back to the same level. This would force the player to find the alternate exit. This was a genius move and was carried on to the Chocolate Island world. The game also introduced the Special world, which was a group of 8 levels that were designed to be harder than the rest of the game. These levels were also very fun and introduced the concept of special worlds to the series.<br /><br /> Both of these games had excellent worlds and level designs, but I feel that 3’s worlds were better because they each had a distinct theme: Grass, Desert, Water, Giant, Sky, Ice, Pipe, and Dark. World had unique worlds that were named after foods, but they didn’t match the quality of the 3rd game.<br /><br />Boss Battles and Levels:<br /> 3’s most iconic levels were, by and far, the Airship levels. The heavy music, the auto-scrolling screen, and the barrage of attacks at the player were all culminating in a battle with one of Bowser’s Koopalings. While the levels were phenomenal, the battles were a little lackluster. The Koopalings would shoot a beam at the player and he would have to dodge it and then stomp on the boss. There were slight variations between each, but they weren’t too much different. Boom-Boom, the mid-world tower boss, was also relatively the same, with him usually just getting faster and gaining wings.<br /><br /> World’s Koopaling bosses were slightly better, with 2 having to be pushed into lava, 2 being able to climb onto ceilings, 2 coming in and out of pipes, and 1 being able to breathe fire. These weren’t too special, but they were an improvement. The tower boss, Reznor, was awful. He was the exact same every time you faced him. Just hit the 4 blocks underneath him, avoid his fire and lave, and you win. They were pathetic battles.<br /><br /> The final battles in each game were both great, but World amped it up a notch. 3 had to avoid Bowser’s fire, while trying to get him to slam the blocks underneath him. This would eventually lead him to fall to his doom, which was a fun idea at the time. World increased the “Wow” factor by having you face Bowser in his flying Clown Car. He would throw Mecha-Koopas down at you, and you would have to throw them back up at him, timing it perfectly to hit his head. Bowser would start to drop giant balls at you and even slam down on you with his car. The princess would pop out at times and throw down a Super Mushroom, which was a relief when the player had one hit. The whole battle was, overall, more cinematic, with thunder noises and lightning flashing, along with the eerie music. At one point, Bowser would fly towards the screen, giving the game the epic feeling that this was a real battle.<br /><br /> The Airship levels were the best levels of the 2 and Boom-Boom was a slightly better mini-boss. The main bosses in World were a little better and the final battle with Bowser was much improved. They were both close to each other with regard to design elements.<br /><br />Final Judgment:<br />Both games have aged very well and are still a blast to play to this day, but 3 is the slightly better game. It had more unique power-ups, distinct world themes, and the amazing Airship levels. World was fun with Yoshi, its alternate exits, and better bosses, but 3 has the edge here.

Some people imagine being a notorious criminal traveling around the globe while committing several crimes and living the life with all the money that they could ever want, plus some. They would be an outlaw on the run. That is what the Wild West has been described as in most fictional stories. Tough characters doing as they please and getting whatever they want are the center of these stories. Saloon fights and gun duels break out, usually over another man’s honor. The Wild West may not be attractive to everyone, but it does have a certain level of excitement that attracts most people. Red Dead Redemption tells the story of John Marston, a former outlaw, as he roams Southern America and Northern Mexico. This is the only Wild West game, to my knowledge, to live up to the standards of the stories. Players are about to be engaged in a tragic tale of love, morals, freedom, and most of all, redemption.<br /><br />What This Game is All About:<br /> Meet John Marston. He is a quite fellow with a dark past. At the start of the game, John is looking for an old acquaintance of his. Throughout the course of the game, he has to go through several different people, towns, and even another country, to find this man, and eventually more. The reason that he does this is left relatively ambiguous at the beginning of the game, and for the sake of preserving the well done story, I shall not reveal it.<br /><br /> If Grand Theft Auto has been played, then this game would feel familiar, but it is not just of rehash of one of 2008’s most popular games. The open-world feel is similar to Grand Theft Auto, but playing it in an open and barren landscape gives the player a whole new sense of isolation. There is no vocal music playing in the background, save for a few story moments. Riding through the land is peaceful and solemn, completely different than Grand Theft Auto’s rush hour traffic and long list of music on the many radio stations. That is just one of the many differences between the similar games, but there are more, so there aren’t any worries for players who were worried about Rockstar, the developer, rehashing a 2 year old game.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /> Despite the differences, the gameplay does borrow heavily from Grand Theft Auto, but this is good. The game’s shooting mechanics are some of the best in gaming. The player can just tap the L1/LT button to automatically aim at a nearby enemy, and they can then freely aim and shoot. For hardcore players, the mode can be switched to remove this auto-aim helper. No matter which play style is chosen, it is still a very smooth shooting mechanic. Since I have not played Grand Theft Auto IV, the latest main entry, I cannot speak for how much has been tweaked, but rest assured, it is fine where it is at.<br /><br /> Riding horses are a fun experience that a car just can’t give you. This is one of the game’s biggest strengths and weaknesses. On the bright side, it makes the player feel like a real cowboy as they ride around. On the negative side, it gets old because of the sprinting mechanism. The player must constantly tap the X/A button for the horse to move. Granted, holding the button will keep the same speed, but it isn’t nearly as fast as tapping. The horse has a stamina meter that can’t be overused or he/she will throw John off. This will require the player to not only tap the button repeatedly, but to monitor the tapping. This gets old fast and is a perfect example of a small annoyance that can sometimes really detract from the experience.<br /><br /> This game gives the player lots of choice, and although none of them drastically affect the story, they are a nice touch. Do I kill my employer and keep all of the money, or do I take my less than a fair share? There are also bounties that the player may accept to gain some quick cash. Fitting the theme of choice, the player can kill the bounty and make it easier on himself or herself, or he or she could take him alive with the trusty lasso and earn a greater reward. Here is the problem: the lasso is too buggy. Switching to the lasso requires the player to use the weapon wheel, which would seem fine at first. The problem is that once the switch happens, the lasso has to be aimed and thrown at the bounty, but he is usually already up and shooting at you. Given the fact that John dies in a few number of shots, this makes taking enemies alive a major annoyance. Some people might take this a problem with me being slow, but sometimes John doesn’t even hold the lasso; he’ll just let go. Why? I don’t know. Maybe I just got a glitch version of the game, but it made another minor problem detract from the experience.<br /><br /> Speaking of glitches, those seem to be the main problem with this game. This game has more glitches than it should. Some characters will completely disappear during a cut scene, while some cut scenes will skip entirely. I don’t care whether or not this is a huge open-world video game, which it is, it should’ve been polished more. The biggest crime of them all isn’t even a glitch itself, it is just poor design; the physics of the game are atrocious. Ragdoll physics in this game do not work. John is just walking along and trips on a rock. The ragdoll turns on and he just rolls all the way down a steep cliff. The screen has reddened because of the damage, but then, a cougar attacks him while he is curled up on the ground. He dies. Why did he have to roll all the way down after tripping on a rock? Why did he let the cougar attack him? These physics are done horribly and disappoint me the most about this game.<br /><br /> Being an open-world Rockstar game, there are a ton of side missions to do, and yet none at the same time. There are bounties, side missions that involve freak strangers, and even Poker. The Poker, Blackjack, and Liar’s Dice games are fun if someone likes them in real life, which I do, so I loved the inclusion. Only a short Poker game is required for the story, so the player isn’t forced to play much. The Five Finger Fillet minigame is fun if someone likes hitting on-screen prompts in a rhythmic fashion, which I also do. The Horseshoe minigame wasn’t all that appealing, but to each their own. The final minigame, Arm Wrestling, is okay; it requires the player to tap the X/A button at certain times during the match to wear down the enemy. Horse breaking is a quick money grab, but it is more of a diversion. These can be fun, but most of these can also get boring quickly, so it really depends on the player. For me, Blackjack, Poker, Liar’s Dice, and Five Finger Fillet were the best.<br /><br /> The game includes challenges for the player to complete and unlock rewards. These range from killing 2 cougars with a knife, which is an awful experience because of the weapon switching, to collecting 10 of a certain plant type. At first, these are fun, but they grew old. Why do I need to collect 10 of a plant type? Shouldn’t 1 or 2 prove that I can find them? These challenges are a perfect example of something added to just make the game seem longer.<br /><br /> When the game is focused on battles, it is at its best. As mentioned above, the shooting is top notch. The problem with open-world games is that they usually have too much breadth, without enough depth. But hey, riding a horse while shooting bandits in sight is always a blast!<br /><br />Story:<br /> The story is a tale of redemption. Although the reasoning isn’t very clear at the beginning of the game, the player does begin to realize the tragic tale of John Marston. It is hard to describe it without revealing spoilers, so I’ll just say that the third act, specifically the ending, is one of gaming’s finest moments.<br /><br /> The voice acting is, as with any Rockstar game, fantastic. When the story feels like it begins to drag along, the voice actors still seemed to hold my interest, especially because of the well-developed characters. Although John does seem one-dimensional at first, his characterization picks up during the third act. Overall, the story is solid.<br /><br />Design:<br /> The world is beautiful. Rockstar have developed fantastic graphics that depict the Wild West in a visually stunning way. The characters sometimes glitch and do animations that were not supposed to happen, or even disappear entirely, but that is expected in an open world game. Mostly, Rockstar has done a fine job in creating this world.<br /><br />Sound:<br />This is my second big problem with this game. The game has a sense of isolation, which seems great at first, but after playing for 20 hours, I begin to wonder why a music playlist wasn’t included in the game. This is why the game can get boring riding around after a while. However, there are 2 key moments during the game when music does play, and it is absolutely beautiful. It makes me wonder why Rockstar didn’t have an entire track list.<br /><br />Difficulty:<br /> The game has that average, normal difficulty. I only died during the course of the story a relatively few number of times. As mentioned above, the games glitches can sometimes kill me, but the actual difficulty level is just about perfect for my taste.<br /><br />Replay Value:<br /> It took me approximately 39.5 hours to 100% complete the game. This really depends on the player. I would say that most of that time was well spent, so it has a fine replay value.<br /><br />Final Judgment:<br />This game will probably be marveled at by most people for years to come, and it should be. I wish that Rockstar would’ve spent more time polishing the game and adding a soundtrack, but I can’t expect perfection. This game is RECOMMENDED to anyone who wants a good story, the experience of being a cowboy, or someone to play Poker with because they are lonely.<br />FINAL SCORE= 9.0", "ParentASIN": "B001SGZL2W", "Timestamp": 1460400019000, "ItemName": "Red Dead Redemption - Playstation 3", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.6, "RatingCount": 1661, "Price": 18.43, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation 3", "Games"], "Description": "The game features a Dead Eye targeting mechanic for improved shot accuracy and expansive open-world gameplay set in the late American Wild West.

Additionally, players can ride horses and encounter over 40 types of animals."}, {"Rating": 5.0, "Title": "Dragons are Fun", "Content": "Note: This review was written as if the game was just released<br /><br />Dragon folklore is derived from 2 backgrounds: European and Chinese. Stories of these mythical beasts have been passed down for generations, with each culture passing down different stories about these flying animals. The 2 cultures have intertwined in recent years, due to more contacts throughout the world. Although it is difficult to pinpoint exact origins for these creatures, they have still remained popular through various mass media, such as books and films.  This game, however, is not the average dragon story.<br /><br />What This Game is All About:<br /> Spyro is the little dragon’s name and flaming minions is his favorite game. At the beginning of the story, the player watches a cut scene with an elderly dragon answering questions for an unseen interviewer. He mentions how there are 6 worlds in the dragon kingdom with 14,000 gems worth of treasure. There is also a very mean guy, who guys by the name of Gnasty Gnorc. After the dragon says some rude insults about Gnasty, Gnasty gets mad. Gnasty fires spells at all of the dragons in the Dragon Realm, freezing them all to stone. He also turns some of the treasure into his personal minions, which account for the enemies that Spyro must face throughout the game. It is up to him to restore order back to the Dragon World.<br /><br /> The objective of the game is relatively simple: free dragons, find treasure, and defeat Gnasty Gnorc. In order to free a dragon, Spyro just has to walk up to him, however, not all of the dragons are just located out in the open. Some got frozen in very unfortunate spots, making the journey a little more difficult than expected. There are a total of 80 dragons to free, with between 12 and 16 scattered through each world. There is also 14,000 gems worth of treasure. The gem values are as follows: Red=1, Green=2, Blue=5, Yellow=10, and Purple=25. These are the 2 main collectables of the game, but there are also dragon eggs. Thieves run around taunting Spyro about how they have an egg, which in retrospect isn’t a very smart thing to do to a dragon. There are 12 eggs scattered throughout the first 3 worlds, while the last 3 worlds have the little rascals running around with treasure instead. All of this count towards 100% completion of the game, and the player needs a set amount in order to progress to each world.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /> Spyro controls rather well, but there is one constant problem throughout the game; the camera is, to put it frankly, garbage. Maybe that is a little harsh, but after 6 worlds of it, it gets on someone’s nerves. It is especially annoying when I glide, by hitting the X button twice, and I can’t see where I’m going, so I end up falling to my death. The player can control the camera with L2 and R2, but it doesn’t go very fast, so he or she ends up having to wait for it to catch up with him or her. As for Spyro’s moves, they are swell. He can charge at enemies or flame them, but he can’t just do this to every enemy. Some enemies have metal, so they must be charged at, while others are too big to be charged, so they must be flamed. Although the enemies are different in each world, this is the basic pattern, but it doesn’t get redundant. Some of the enemies’ animations are actually pretty funny.<br /><br /> Spyro’s health system is unique. He has a dragonfly, of course, that follows him around. Every time Spyro takes a hit, his color changes, from yellow to blue to green. When Sparx, the dragonfly, is gone, Spyro has one hit left. Spyro can refill Sparx’s health by attacking local animal fodder, which release butterflies to heal Sparx and, therefore, protect Spyro. It is a unique system.<br /><br /> There are 6 levels in each of the first 5 worlds. There is a hub level, which leads to the other 5, a flying level (more on that in a bit), 3 main levels, and a mini-boss level (more on that as well). Each level has treasure for Spyro to collect and the only levels that have no dragons to free are the flying levels. The main levels are fairly linear, but they have some diverging pathways for Spyro to explore (and maybe find some secrets, too).<br /><br /> The flight levels are a blast. Spyro starts out flying, and he has to go through, burn, or destroy 32 different assortments of objects, with 8 objects times 4 types. The player is timed, but getting each object adds more time. While these levels are all under 2 minutes long, they are still fun, but there isn’t much incentive to replay them for a better time. The record should be its own reward, but there are only 5 of these levels, and the player can only view them by going back to the level. Aside from that, they are still very fun.<br /><br /> The bosses in the game are severely lacking. The only boss that must be defeated is Gnasty Gnorc, so the other 5 are entirely optional. They are usually located towards the middle of the level, with each hit Spyro marks upon them driving them closer to the end. The fights are okay, but I feel that something could’ve been added to make them more worthwhile, instead of just being a chase and burn battle.<br /><br /> There are 2 power-ups in the game that Spyro can obtain. The first is a super charge ability, gained by running on super charge tracks. These are used very effectively to find some well-hidden secrets. The other isn’t as apparent, but it is still fun. It is a super flame that is granted by a fairy. This ability allows Spyro to burn metal objects and enemies, along with making him red. Both are fun and well used.<br /><br />The gameplay is still awesome, but they could’ve most definitely refined the camera, and maybe done a better job with the boss battles, but all in all, it is still fun. Something that must be mentioned, however, is the final, bonus level. The player must already have 100% completion, but it is completely worth it. Without spoiling anything, just know that it is the best level in the entire game.<br /><br />Story:<br /> There isn’t much story to the game. There are a few laughs gained with the enemies, but nothing heavy in the story department. There are only 3 cut scenes in the game, so that should be a notice. This doesn’t detract too much from the main experience, but it also doesn’t help by not having much.<br /><br />Design:<br /> The levels are designed nicely. It isn’t anything amazing, but it is still very nice to look at. The enemies, however, are designed very uniquely. My favorite design for the enemies is the design used for the last, normal level, right before Gnasty Gnorc. Insomniac did a good job with the PlayStation hardware.<br /><br />Sound:<br />The music in the game is phenomenal. I love it. It really gets me excited when I play, especially as I’m charging with super speed throughout some parts of the game. It is very exhilarating and I love it.<br /><br />Difficulty:<br /> The game is rather easy, but not super easy. The secrets are well hidden, but not impossible to figure out. I feel that the difficulty was nicely balanced.<br /><br />Replay Value:<br /> One could probably 100% the entire game in less than 10 hours. It is a blast, but still short. There isn’t much replay value because of the lack of story, but it is fun while it lasts.<br /><br />Final Judgment:<br />This game is RECOMMENDED. It isn’t a masterpiece by any means, but it is still a solid game that any platformer fan would enjoy. The camera needs some reworking, the boss battles need something to differentiate them, and the game needs to last. However, it is still great.<br />FINAL SCORE= 8.75", "ParentASIN": "B00000I1BF", "Timestamp": 1460398721000, "ItemName": "Spyro the Dragon", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.6, "RatingCount": 741, "Price": 38.36, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"], "Description": "E FOR EVERYONE VIBRATION FUNCTION MEMORY CARD 1 BLK 3D GAME is a gaming accessory that features a memory card with vibration functionality, designed for a 3D gaming experience."}, {"Rating": 5.0, "Title": "Gaming's Newest Gang", "Content": "Note: This review was written as if the game was just released<br /><br /> Starting at a very young age, we are told that stealing is wrong, and that we should never do it. There are laws that punish those who steal and it is usually frowned upon by society. Well, this game is telling you the exact opposite: steal, steal, and keep stealing. There have been popular games that revolve around sneaking, such as Thief and Metal Gear Solid, but none have been done in such a unique style. Playing as a raccoon who steals is not only clever, but also exceptionally fun. The game contains a wide array of characters, all of which are animals. This style makes the stealing seem less bad, but still richly rewarding. What other game has you play as a raccoon, with a turtle and hippo as his sidekicks, all while evading a fox cop? I don’t know a game that does.<br /><br />What This Game is All About:<br /> The player starts the game by watching a short, in-game cut scene. A raccoon is prowling throughout the night on rooftops far above ground level. He jumps gracefully across each building, all while remaining silent. He stops on one rooftop, and the game prompts the player to press start. When you press start, the game starts right then and there. It is nice to have the game just start right up at the beginning; it adds a certain cinematic feel. After completing the prologue level, a cut scene starts up to explain the backdrop of the story.<br /><br /> The protagonist, Sly (how ironic), was born from a family that is known for their thieving skills. However, what makes them different from ordinary thieves is not only their great skill, but also the fact that they have an honor code: they only steal from other thieves. Although this doesn’t exactly make them a Robin Hood, it does reveal that the family isn’t necessarily bad people, and neither is Sly. As I played throughout the game, I found that he has a very caring heart. During Sly’s youth, a rival gang attacked his home and killed his father. What they wanted was the family book, known as the Thievius Raccoonus. It lists the family’s greatest heists and some of their greatest techniques, both of which would be invaluable for any thief. Sly ends up in an orphanage and meets his lifelong friends, Bentley and Murray (more on them in the Story section). Basically, the player goes throughout the game trying to recover your lost heirloom, all while defeating the gang that took it.<br /><br /> The game has 2 main items: Treasure Keys and Clue Bottles. There are 7 Treasure Keys in the first 4 areas of the game, one being assigned to each level, while the fifth and last area has none. You have to complete the 7 levels in order to face the boss of that area and reclaim a piece of your book. Clue Bottles, on the other hand, are entirely optional. There are between 20 and 40 in some levels, with none in levels that are designed like minigames. By collecting all of the bottles in a level, Sly gains a code to open that level’s vault. After finding the vault and typing in the code, you gain a nice bonus. This is either a page from your book that teaches you a new move, such as a dive attack, or blueprints for that area, which reveal where the bottles are in your binocucom (your binoculars and communication device with your teammates). All in all, there are 19 Vaults in the game. After opening the vault and completing the level, Sly may also complete an optional Master Thief Sprint. These are just time trials for the individual levels. Completing these allow the player to listen to some commentary for that level. Now that the basics of the game are covered, let’s move on to how the gameplay is.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /> Playing as Sly Cooper makes me feel light as a feather. He jumps from one point to the next in very gracious moves. When the player sees blue sparks and hit the circle button, Sly does a sneaky move. For example, after completing the second area, Sly gains 2 moves: the rail walk and rail slide. The rail walk lets Sly walk across tight ropes and rails, allowing an ease of movement across the game. The rail slide lets Sly slide very quickly throughout parts of the level. These moves are very useful and also fun to use. My only complaint is that even though Sly gains these moves as he progresses, it doesn’t feel like it because there isn’t any backtracking in the game. He goes from level to level, and since the circle the button is used for all of these moves, it just seems like a new animation instead of an actual new move. However, they are still a blast to use.<br /><br /> Sly attacks with his cane. This cane allows simple whacking moves to defeat Sly’s enemies, but the designers made it more than just a simple weapon; they also made it into a useful tool for the player. The cane can be used to swing on hooks located throughout the game. This is a nifty feature that was implemented into the game, and it makes the cane feel like an extension of Sly’s arm.<br /><br /> The health system is slightly different in this game, but it works just fine. Sly only has one hit, but so do most enemies. Sly can get a Horseshoe that gives Sly an extra hit. Collecting another one will turn it Gold and give Sly another extra hit. Sly can also receive one by collecting 100 coins. After that, Sly just starts to receive extra lives.<br /><br /> The levels in the game are short and sweet. Some levels could be completed in less than 10 minutes, while most won’t even take a half-hour. This may make the player yearn for more, but at least it allows a variety of locations to be seen throughout the area. Most levels do just involve going from point A to point B, but there are 2 that involve Sly escaping from the police. These levels are my favorite because they add that urgency to the level. You’re not only trying to get the Treasure Key and Clue Bottles, but also trying to avoid getting shot by a deadly shock pistol.<br />Some levels are minigames, with my personal favorite being the 2 where Sly controls a turret to clear a path for Sly’s hippo friend, Murray. You shoot enemies and obstacles in the way as he makes his way toward a treasure key. There are also racing minigames, although the controls are a little goofy. The analog stick is not only used to steer, but also to accelerate, so it is a little weird to have to hold the stick forward, instead of just holding the X button. Another minigame has Sly control a hover bike, of sorts, while shooting enemies and obstacles in his path, and these are also very fun levels. There are some other minigames, but those are the main ones. While I do like the appeal that these minigames give me, they also make the game even shorter than it already is (more on that in the Replayability section).<br /><br /> The gameplay of this game is really well done. There isn’t much to complain about, except for the occasional jumping error that persists in virtually every platform game ever made.<br /><br />Story:<br /> This game’s story has it all. It is cool, touching, exhilarating, and a little saddening. Sly Cooper is the cool guy that younger kids want to be, while Bentley, the turtle, is the brains of the gang. He communicates with Sly the most and gives him helpful hints throughout the game. His tech jargon is downright hilarious (although I do consider myself a nerd). Bentley is just an awesome character that really shows how important nerds are. Murray, the hippo, is the lovable oaf. He drives the gang van and helps to get Treasure Keys in the field sometimes. While Sly doesn’t communicate with him much, I still got that oaf feeling from him. Inspector Carmelita Montoya Fox is the cop that chases Sly and the gang throughout the game. While “Ms. Fox,” as Sly would say, is completely focused on her job, Sly enjoys flirting with her, despite them being on opposite sides of the law. It is funny to hear them banter back and forth. Aside from the prologue that was already established, there isn’t much else to the game’s story, until the last area. This area is where things start to pick up. The final villain in the game is one of my favorite villains in gaming, as it represents the epitome of evil. The last area is a high tension episode. While the story isn’t anything award worthy, it does do its job just fine, especially with the amazing characters.<br /><br />Design:<br /> This game is beautifully designed, with the cel-shaded graphics making it seem like an actual comic book, which the cut scenes are made to look like. This entire game has a cartoon feel to it, even having Sly do wacky death animations. The worlds are also beautiful. This game makes very good use of its inspirations.<br /><br />Sound:<br />The music is fine. When things get tense, it gets louder, especially during the chase levels. When things are quite, it is quite and eerie, especially during the third area of the game, which is a swampland run by a voodoo reptilian. The game has nice music.<br /><br />Difficulty:<br /> This game is exceptionally easy. I know of an 8 year old that beat every part of this game, except for the Master Thief Sprints, by himself, all with relative ease. I don’t mind easy games, but it doesn’t provide much of a challenge, so don’t go in expecting a game that tests Sly’s true thieving ability. It is, like another game that I have reviewed (see Jak and Daxter), a very relaxing game, but I believe that it is even easier than that.<br /><br />Replay Value:<br /> This game is also very, very short. It could very well be beaten in less than 6 hours. Even if the player does all of the Master Thief Sprints, which I have not, it would still probably take less than 10 hours. Even with this problem, the player will probably end up wanting to replay the game anyways because of how fun it is and how interesting the story and characters are. The only real thing going for replay value is its story, so the player will have to take that into heavy consideration. With all of that being said, a rent at first would be best.<br /><br />Final Judgment:<br />This game is RECOMMENDED. It provides almost everything that should be expected out of a game. The atmosphere of stealing, doing sneaky moves, and being in a comic book inspired world, all combine to form a great package. However, it is easy and short, even with the added time trials. As stated above, I would rent it first to see if someone would enjoy it enough to determine if someone would want to ever replay it. This game serves its purpose very nicely, and I wouldn’t mind a sequel at all (there is a sequel).

Although it didn’t start the actual genre, Super Mario 64 is considered the father of 3D platform games and started the craze that led to many imitations and several successful games. 3D platforming stemmed off from the extremely successful, arguably the most of any video game genre, 2D platform gameplay. However, it wasn’t as easy as just switching to 3D. Several mechanics had to be changed, such as jumping. Characters didn’t just jump straight; characters could jump in any direction. Super Mario 64 acknowledged these problems and worked around them to create one of the most popular and successful sub-genres in all of video game history. I am happy to say that Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy has come very close to perfecting this genre.<br /><br />What This Game is All About:<br /> The game is started out by having the player listen to what sounds like an older man questioning the world he lives in and how it came to be. He then starts to say that he feels that the answers are intertwined with a young boy’s destiny and how this boy is reckless (pfft…teenagers). The boy, whose name is Jak, is with his friend Daxter on a boat. They are heading to an island that Daxter claims they weren’t supposed to go to. Long story short, they go there, they run into trouble, Daxter gets turned into an “Ottsel” (a mix between an otter and weasel), they go back to their place, and they end up finding out that the only way to change Daxter back is to find a sage who lives “far to the north.” So, they begin their adventure.<br /><br /> The playable character is Jak, with Daxter sitting on his shoulder. In a brief training level, they find out about several items that they must collect: Power Cells, Precursor Orbs, and Scout Flies. Power Cells are the main collectible in the games, similar to the Stars in Super Mario 64. They get these for completing tasks, such as helping a farmer herd his Yakows into his fence to finding one in a secret room that can only accessed with the correct Eco (the game’s version of power-ups). There are about one-hundred Power Cells in the game. Precursor Orbs are far more abundant (there are two-thousand of these suckers) and are a currency used in the game to obtain Power Cells off of certain characters in the game. Scout Flies are artificial scouting creatures created by one of the protagonists who help them throughout the game. They have been trapped and there are exactly seven in each level; finding all seven will yield one of the many Power Cells. Basically, the characters use these Power Cells to power zoomers (similar to the ones in Return of the Jedi) and cross deadly lava pits or canyons. These are necessary to progress throughout the game. Those are the collectibles of the game, so let’s get down to the gameplay.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /> The gameplay is obviously one of the biggest reasons someone may want to play this game. Let me just say, it doesn’t disappoint. Being a platforming game, one of the most important functions of the game is the ability to not only jump, but to be able to do it with ease and grace, while still making the player feel in control. It mostly succeeds in that goal. There were a few times when I felt I jumped correctly, but the landing wasn’t where I expected it to be, however, those instances were rare and they don’t detract from the game. Playing as Jak is also one of the smoothest game experiences ever; he moves so easily and stops as soon as I let go of the analog stick. The game has very responsive controls, to be blunt about it.<br /><br /> For the mission objectives, they are varied and done with style. One mission had me get ambushed by Lurkers, the main enemy group of the game, while another had me try to defeat a giant, evil plant. Those are the action goals. Others are more platforming focused, such as climbing a huge underground site, with several obstacles and poles to swing from. There are also several minigames, all of which are fun and engaging. One of these minigames had me catching two-hundred pounds of fish for a local fisherman, and it made me focus, but it wasn’t frustrating. Another gameplay mechanic is the zoomer and Flut-Flut. The former is what it sounds like and it controls pretty well, but it isn’t the best to handle, but that adds to the feel. The Flut-Flut, on the other hand, is a giant, bird-like creature that Jak rides in a similar manner to how Mario rides Yoshi; the bird even has a flutter jump. The bird is probably my favorite aspect of the game, gameplay-wise. It, like Jak, controls very well and it also isn’t overused, so it was a treat for the few times I got to use it. Jak must, however, have to complete a certain mission before using it.<br /><br /> Eco is the game’s versions of power-ups. They grant Jak temporary powers that can be used to defeat enemies, solve puzzles, and just be awesome. Green Eco heals Jak, Blue Eco gives him speed and access to open/activate certain areas of the game, Yellow Eco allows him to shoot fiery Eco blasts, and Red Eco makes Jak stronger. These different types of Eco are used throughout the game to help Jak on his quest and are really fun to use. As a side note, Dark Eco is bad.<br /><br /> Despite my almost-complete positive outlook on the gameplay so far, it isn’t perfect. As stated above, the jumps don’t quite work always, but I feel that way with all platformers, so that may be me and not the game. Also, the camera doesn’t always line up correctly, so a few jumps may get missed due to that reason. This next reason isn’t really a complaint, but just something that needs to be said: the game doesn’t add much new to the platforming category, but just refines several of its attributes.<br /><br /> There are two ideas that were implemented into the game that, although not noticeable at first, make a huge difference when another game is played. The first idea is that there is almost zero loading. The game has very, very brief loading when the game data is saved and loaded, but that is it. There is no loading between levels, although there are a couple levels that are up a mountain or across water and requires slight waiting. Other than those couple instances, there is no loading. It is a beauty to be able to travel through a seamless, connected world. The game really is just one, big level. It may seem trivial, but the next time that another game is played, I’ll remember. There are also warp gates to travel to a previous home-area (they have no enemies and are in the middle of the action levels, as I call them), so the player doesn’t have to find a way all the way back.<br /><br /> The other idea is that when Jak dies, your Ottsel friend, Daxter, says a hilarious comment. These can range from “How am I gonna get changed back now!” to “Hey, Jak! Can I have your insect collection?” There are probably a good fifteen of these death scenes and they are extremely funny and can lighten the mood if it felt like a cheap death. Also, whenever Jak gets a Power Cell, Daxter does a funky dance and these are nice to see. There are probably fifteen of these, too.<br /><br /> Overall, the gameplay is exemplary and does a magnificent job of keeping true to the formula of 3D platformers. It may not be new, but the refinement level is top-notch.<br /><br />Story:<br /> The story doesn’t get into much detail (most platformers don’t), but it has hilarious moments thanks to the character interaction. Daxter is probably one of the funniest video game characters that I have ever seen, and most of the funny scenes involve him in some way. What the game doesn’t have in story, it makes up for with witty character dialogue.<br /><br />Design:<br /> The worlds are designed in one the most amazing ways possible. This is a living, breathing world. It also shows what the PS2 is truly capable of doing with graphics. These are probably some of the best graphics out there on any video game console, as of 2001.<br /><br />Sound:<br /> The sound effects are pleasing to hear and the music is very well done. The music that plays when Jak receives a Power Cell lets the player know that he or she just accomplished something. The level music is also very relatable to the level itself. I’m not a music expert, but when I see a green and brightly colored land, I think happy. The game executes music sounding like what a level looks like very well.<br /><br />Difficulty:<br /> One of the major qualms that some people may have with the game, is the difficulty. To most people, they would probably find it to be exceptionally easy, especially if they have played several 3D platformers and have become very adept. I didn’t have a problem with it, because I felt it fit with the game. It is a very relaxing experience and although platformer masters may not find it appealing, they would be foolish to ignore the game because of that.<br /><br />Replay Value:<br /> This is the heart-breaker of the deal. The game is very short. The game could be beaten in less than six hours. I fully beat it in about ten hours and wasn’t rushing nor taking in every little detail to the game. I do recommend replaying the game not only because it is great, but because I feel that it would be good for speed-runs, even if that wasn’t an intention. It is easy enough for most gamers and could pose a challenge for masters who want extremely fast times. For those who aren’t interested, it is still more than worthy for a single playthrough.<br /><br />Final Judgment:<br /> This game is RECOMMENDED. Although there are a few gameplay mechanics that irk me at times, they don’t detract from the overall experience. It is a short game, but amusement can be found in replaying for speed runs or just because it is enjoyable and downright funny. At the very least, the game should be rented and played through once. Then, a decision can be made on whether it should be bought. I, personally, am happy that what feels like an end to the 3D platforming age is going out with a very high-quality game.<br />FINAL SCORE= 9.25", "ParentASIN": "B00005R5PO", "Timestamp": 1460345979000, "ItemName": "Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.7, "RatingCount": 739, "Price": 14.95, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation 2", "Games"], "Description": "The game is rated \"Everyone\" by the ESRB and falls under the action/adventure genre."}]}

When I heard they were remastering this game I couldn’t miss out! It’s striking how updated the team did for the game with the textures and the lighting. Combat and stealth get an upgrade by having a better HUD, can aim with ranged weapons, mini map that indicates the enemies direction as well as type. In stealth, you can whistle from bushes to lure enemies.<br /><br />Despite these pros to the game, it does suffer some glitches at some points of play. I did have a case where I was trying to watch a cutscene and the screen turned completely white. I had to restart from the last checkpoint and it ran well after that. Snow does glitch when exploring in winter. But to me it’s minor and doesn’t bother me that much. I hope these problems can be easily fixed in the next few months. Otherwise the game is still solid.<br />I know at the time many fans did not enjoy the game. I think with this remaster I could change their minds. If you are a new to Assassin’s Creed, this remaster is inexpensive to the the more higher quality games that came out the last 2 years. Plot is explained well and the twists that occur make the best moments of the game. Being a historian, aside from its tale of inaccuracies in terms of the overall plot, this game in context is the closest to actual history.<br />The community of Assassin’s Creed has thrown the main protagonist under the bus because he didn’t fit the previous formula. But I think that is what it makes it special compared to the ones that preceded it. I think it was a tough risk to show a character in the end didn’t get everything. Fans found the guy naive, ignorant, and having no humor. I contest he did have human qualities but I say what would you have done in his position?<br />I know I’m going off the rails now so I will end on a high note.

While it feels like at first a coming of age tale, it then grows into an epic quest in identity, intrigue, and betrayal. This is a generality with no spoilers.<br />What I can see that disappointed me is that when talking to NPC’s the animations while good are quite robotic to look at and are not as organic in conversation. Luckily, with the included Winter Wilds dlc, the animations are improved so much I can give it a pass. However, the pacing and grind while playing can be extremely tedious in order to survive against the machines(robots) as you traverse the landscape.

Without the proper info you will NOT reap the best benefits that the new S model offers. I'm going to talk about 4K upscaling, HDR and the IR blaster.<br /><br />First is the 4k upscaling. This part is simple, you need a 4k TV and make sure in the settings of the XBOX you have the picture resolution set to 4k UHD. Second is the HDR (High Dynamic Range), this part is pretty tricky, but if you follow the right steps this can actually greatly improve lighting effects and colors in games, movies and apps that support it. You'd be surprised at how good this makes the games look. First thing you need is a 4K TV that has HDR. You'll need to do some research online to see if your TV supports it but most TVs over a year old won't have it. If you go to the &#34;display&#34; settings on the xbox and look for advanced settings, than go to 4K TV details and it will tell everything your TV supports. If it says it doesn't support HDR than don't give up just yet. If you have a smart TV than make sure you have the most current update. You may be lucky and get an update that gives it to you. Even worse is that there are two different kinds of HDR. From what I know, all the new 4K model's from samsung, sony and LG support the one you need, however, Vizio currently does not. I believe Vizio is working on an update that would support it but I'm not 100% on that. Now in order to get the HDR working you need to go to your TV settings and look for dynamic range setting or HDR setting (This should be located in your picture settings of the TV) and make sure that your inputs are set to full (or whatever your tv may call it in the menu) not auto, on my tv when its set to auto the HDR doesn't work with the xbox.

The game is all Jack Joyce, the vigilante fighting to take down a corrupt and powerful cooperation and the show follows a number of people who work for that cooperation who don't really understand whats going on. The show is also very violent and adult, which I found surprising as well.<br /><br />  we've seen time powers before but not like this. The way time is used in the story is unique but whats even more awesome is the time powers in the game. The stronger you get, the more like a superhero you feel. I played on hard though which I recommend or I think the game may be a little easy otherwise. Anyways, the game is awesome, the show is great.

As a hardcore Final Fantasy fan, I find it hard to start on how disappointing this game is.<br /><br />First of all, the characters. They're lame. The main character is this stupid monkey boy who's part of a theater troupe. That's not very badass! After making the super cool ex SOLDIER Cloud and SeeD in training Squall, what was Squaresoft thinking? Did they not look back at the past final fantasies and get that the protagonist is supposed to be a badass? Losers hanging with this failure of a protagonist include a little kid with no face (who came up with THAT design?), an annoying guy in armor who always jumps up and down, a girl with purple hair (lol, is this an supposed to be an anime?), and another girl that's named after a weapon she doesn't even use, awesome. None of these characters are as awesome as Barret or as hot as Tifa and they all look like they came out of a cartoon, another failure on Squaresoft's part.<br /><br />Next, the story. It's stupid. The only thing I can recall from my boredom is that it involves stealing a princess during a play performance (wtf?) and preventing an airship from blowing up or something like that. The main villain is some fat blue lady. What the hell is that about? While playing this I just sat there wishing Sephiroth would jump into the scene and stab her! I stopped playing after the first disc, where in the end some white haired chick looks down at the dead characters and flies off on a dragon (was that supposed to be a female Sephiroth or what? who cares) The world was boring. It was all castles and medieval crap like that. Hello! Final Fantasies are supposed to take place in futuristic worlds with technology and guns!<br /><br />Lastly, the battle system. What a pile of crap. Only the stupid kid can cast black magic, the girl is the only one who can heal, and the other guys are the only ones who can use real weapons. What kinda system is that? It's like they're each supposed to have a designated role! You're supposed to have 'em learn spells though materia! Oh wait, only REAL Final Fantasies are allowed to have materia, my bad. Also, why do you control four party members? First of all, that makes this game even more confusing and stupid, and second of all, REAL Final Fantasies have only three party members!<br /><br />In conclusion, this game fails to please any Final Fantasy fan due to to Squaresoft's failure to take a look at the franchise's  roots. If Square had looked back and reflected on what made Final Fantasy such a great series to begin with, they would have known this game would be a disappointment to any longtime Final Fantasy fan such as myself.", "ParentASIN": "B00004Y57G", "Timestamp": 1249097846000, "ItemName": "Final Fantasy IX", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.7, "RatingCount": 1921, "Price": null, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation", "Games"], "Description": "In Final Fantasy IX, the world of Gaia faces dark times as four nations engage in a power struggle, driven by greed and justice.

RE4 set a new standard for the survivor-horror genre and resurrected the Resident Evil franchise. Does RE5 try to be just as ground-breaking as RE4? No, RE5 instead tries to simulate and perfect the RE4 experience by incorporating a number of changes.<br /><br />The biggest change is that this game is on the next generation (or should I say current generation) of consoles. The graphics are some of the best the 360 and PS3 currently have to offer. Of course, the wonderful graphics are almost a given considering a company with high production values such as Capcom developing a game on the next generation consoles. The real changes are the ones made to the gameplay.<br /><br />The first major gameplay change is the co-op focus. Our hero Chris Redfield is paired up with sidekick Sheva at all times in the game. Having another armed person always by your side definitely take away the thrill factor that was present in RE4, but it makes this Resident Evil fun in another sort of way. When playing alone (such as I did) your partner Sheva is controlled by the AI. The AI is hard to describe. Most of the time it operates perfectly. Sheva seemed to have perfect aim with the rifle I gave her and definitely saved me from death more than once. However, there are certain points in the game when the AI poorly handles the situation at hand. Worst of all, these are points were you cannot just take matters into your own hand. Chris and Sheva are sometimes required to split up and if Sheva can't handle her own, there's little you can do to alleviate the problem. Fortunately, this problem only comes into play if you are playing alone. If you plan to play with another person, these situations won't show up.<br /><br />The other game play change is the changes made to the inventory system. Compared to RE4's attache case system, RE5's is both a step forward and a step backward. The good news is that you no longer have to pause the game in the heat of the action to switch weapons or pick up ammo. You can assign your various guns and what have you to the four directions on the d-pad. Rather than pausing and scrolling through the menu to select your gun, just push up on the d-pad and out comes your weapon. There are other slots in your inventory for ammo and curatives that can be chosen by holding triangle (or Y on the 360 I'd assume) This too does not break up the in-game action. The problem with this system is that you only get an un-upgradeable 9 slots of inventory. Sure you had to manage space in RE4's attache case, but at least that system was fair. Here, one item can go in each slot, be it a gun, an herb, or an egg. Yes, an egg takes up just as much space as a gun. It's quite frustrating when your full inventory makes it unable for you to pick up a red herb, because the only destiny a red herb has is to be combined with a green herb, but before you can do that they both have to have their own slot in the inventory. You have to manage Sheva's inventory if you're playing alone, dictating what guns and ammo she'll be getting or not getting. You can request any item she may have for yourself, so the whole item management between the two of you isn't a total conundrum.<br /><br />I can't say for you if the plot is better than that in RE4, but I can say that it is much more related to past Resident Evils than RE4's was. Whether this is a good or bad thing is up to the player.<br /><br />In conclusion, there's no reason somebody who was pleased with RE4 wouldn't be pleased (if not more) by RE5. It has everything that made RE4 great along with new features and that next-gen flair to keep things fresh.", "ParentASIN": "B001E8WQKY", "Timestamp": 1247962861000, "ItemName": "Resident Evil 5 - Xbox 360", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.5, "RatingCount": 765, "Price": 29.88, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "Xbox Systems", "Xbox 360", "Games"], "Description": "Join Chris Redfield or Sheva Alomar in a horror-filled mission with a new two-player online co-op mode.

The classic mascot characters have endured the years to become videogame icons, recognized and loved by millions of game addicts around the globe. Nintendo's fat, Italian plumber helped pioneer the platformer genre and SEGA's blue hedgehog transformed it completely, placing a new emphasis on speed and rollercoaster-inspired level designs. In the old days, Mario and Sonic stood on even ground, each taking lead roles in an impressive selection of critically acclaimed titles. But as the years passed and consoles become more and more powerful, Mario's inevitable jump to the third dimension faired much better than Sonic's. Case in point: Super Mario 64 is remembered even today as one of the greatest games of all time. Sonic Adventure for Sega Dreamcast is conversely thought of as a flawed, but still enjoyable sequel by hardcore fans, and an altogether broken platformer by everybody else.<br /><br />It is more than a little puzzling, therefore, that developers SEGA Studios USA and Sonic Team continue to draw upon that archaic, clunky design for various Hedgehog-based sequels. Sonic Adventure 2, for instance, hit Dreamcast and was later ported to GameCube with the same fundamental mechanics and shortcomings that blemished the original title. And now, the software house has created Shadow the Hedgehog for GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, a game that looks and plays like it was designed for Dreamcast a full six years ago. Sonic's darker half occasionally shines in the same way that its predecessors did -- namely, with an impressive sense of speed and dazzling stages complete with trademark twists and turns. And it's solely for these reasons that anybody who defends the original Sonic Adventure will probably like Shadow's one. Alternatively, though, players unimpressed with Sonic's Dreamcast outings will find more of the same here, and unlike a fine wine, age has not improved the formula.<br /><br />Identity Crisis<br /><br />Shadow the Hedgehog seems to be Sonic Team's unofficial attempt at aging up its platformer games and as a result the title regularly deals with slightly darker and more convoluted themes that center on the balance between good and evil. The story is kick-started by a gorgeously rendered full-motion animation cinematic that introduces players to the troubled Hedgehog, who has recently lost his memory and is struggling to come to grips with his place in the world. The tale picks up after the events in Sonic Heroes and consequently Shadow can only vaguely recall in flashbacks that there was a girl named Maria, he may have loved her, and she was murdered.<br /><br />Shadow isn't allowed much alone time before his thought process is so rudely interrupted by the sounds of war and destruction. An alien threat called Black Arms explodes onto the scene and demolishes everything in its path, including nearby city skyscrapers. This is, again, all illustrated in impressive FMA cut-scenes that seasoned Sonic fans will undoubtedly appreciate. Shadow observes this phenomenon with a level of indifference before he is approached by a demon-like figure known as Black Doom, who leads the extraterrestrial forces. The menacing entity acts as though he knows Shadow and commands the Hedgehog to retrieve the seven powerful Chaos Emeralds located throughout the land. The anti-hero begrudgingly agrees, but only because Black Doom promises to restore his memory immediately after the artifacts are collected.<br /><br />This oddball setup is supposed to extend into and become an integral part of the gameplay experience. Shadow is out for himself and therefore he can and in fact does switch allegiances depending on the preferences of players. The hedgehog can be made to carry out Black Doom's commands, or he can switch sides and team up with Sonic and friends, or even Dr. Eggman. Changing teams is as simple as tapping the D-Pad during gameplay. One quick tap and Shadow will find himself being guided to various goals, such as destroying G.U.N. troops, for Black Doom. Another tap and Sonic and friends will appear at his side to fight against the Black Arms.<br /><br />The concept itself is intriguing primarily because it enables gamers to choose different paths for themselves as the hero advances through the adventure. The choices made will have a direct bearing on the stages that follow thanks to a branching storyline that allows for several possible paths and endings. This is a clever way to extend replay value and we're confident that completionists will play through the title several times, switching allegiances, so that they may see everything that there is to see.<br /><br />However, observing the unique goals per different allegiances is a messy undertaking marred by poor design. The fact of the matter is that any level of serious planned strategizing is wholly unobtainable in the intensely frantic makeup of the game, whose mechanics perpetually dart Shadow forward with both limited visibility and control. In turn, even when gamers are trying to fight alongside Sonic and friends, they will accidentally dispose of hordes of allies and even zoom into and activate switches or complete puzzle components that they should ignore. This truth renders the entire operation of choosing sides more or less useless.<br /><br />Speed, Loops and Guns, But Very Little Fun<br /><br />Dreamcast owners will already have an unfortunately accurate idea of how Shadow the Hedgehog plays (and for that matter, looks). To be brief, like Sonic Adventure before it. What this means is that speed and forward momentum are emphasized over control, puzzles, or to be frank, depth. Honestly, that isn't always a bad thing. Shadow, like Sonic before him, has his redeeming gameplay moments. We're referring to the rollercoaster-like stages complete with loop-de-loops, corkscrews and pinball bouncers that send the hedgehog zigzagging up and down environments at remarkable speeds. Because these scenarios are still plentiful, undeterred supporters of Sonic Team's efforts will undoubtedly find something to like about Shadow's quest.<br /><br />That noted, these thrill-ride fundamentals have outworn their welcome, as far as we're concerned. Just because they dazzled players six years ago does not mean that Sonic Team can copy and paste exactly the same loops and spins into each new franchise iteration and expect everyone to be happy with the outcome. Admittedly, Shadow is at its best when the character is zipping through 360s and or skating a rollercoaster track. But it's also during these moments that the game plays itself. It is, in fact, possible, for participants to put their controllers down for seconds at a time and simply watch what unfolds. How is relinquishing control for what amounts to watching Shadow tumble through a scripted corkscrew a rewarding play environment?<br /><br />Unfortunately for Sonic's darker half, there are all-new problems exclusive to his adventure. The very first level in Shadow the Hedgehog is a shining example of spectacularly lackluster game design and probably one of the worst single stages that we've played in any title for many months. The reluctant hero is thrust into a drab environment and immediately nudged forward -- right into a progression of objects, including obstructing walls and enemies. Disappointingly, the platformer also features a horrendously malfunctioned camera system that catches on environments or even occasionally runs amok for no particular discernible reason. The result? Commonly frustrating undertakings where the goal is to burst forward and gain speed, but before that can happen Shadow crashes into enemies and loses rings, or simply goes careening off a ledge. These impossibly trying outcomes are worsened because Shadow moves loosely through the worlds he explores, which at times makes precision navigation an insurmountable hurdle.<br /><br />The character can, unlike Sonic, wield a number of imposing weapons, from massive swords to explosive projectiles. But in a move that again harkens back to the days of Dreamcast, there is no lock-on system in place and therefore what is a simple process in other titles is overly complex and cumbersome here. Successfully targeting and unloading a bazooka shot at an enemy may as well be left to chance. Sonic Team has positioned Shadow's gunplay as a primary selling point to the platformer, but in practice the mechanics are really not that enjoyable.<br /><br />Recycled technology and replicated production values have ensured that Shadow the Hedgehog looks and sounds almost exactly like its Sonic-based predecessors. To Sonic Team's credit, there are more than 20 levels in the game and each is varied in design. Some areas have a futuristic look to them while others feature large metropolis backgrounds and more still take Shadow through lava and forest settings. Meanwhile, the game engine draws long, stretching locales populated with a moderate number of polygonal characters. And on GameCube and Xbox, the fluidity usually aspires for the 60 frames per second mark with some dips. The PlayStation 2 version is noticeably more sluggish despite the fact that it is visually lacking compared to its counterparts. And yet, these are small graphic victories, especially when held to today's more robust standards. Shadow oftentimes looks like it could have been designed for Dreamcast simply because the worlds and characters lack polygon numbers, which leads to a generally square presentation void of curvy shapes. Worse is that many of the game's textures are downright muddy, especially when the camera malfunctions and pans up close, as it consistently does. And overall character animation is primitive and incomplete when compared to the majority of today's games.<br /><br />Shadow the Hedgehog is proof that Sonic Team needs to get with the program if it plans to compete with legitimate current and next- generation software. This is Sonic Adventure with guns and less polish, and players today are far more discerning than they were six years ago. Diehard Sonic fans will cling to the fact that the title still conjures up corkscrews and loop-de-loops, as well as an impressive sense of speed when Shadow really gets moving, and this is all true.

The question is: where do you draw the line between when simplistic gameplay intended for a child becomes a bad game.

Dated looking special effects? Some silly looking hunter with an accent? Robin Willaims in a dress as he babysits his kids in his ex-wife's house? Same movie, right? Regardless, Zathura follows along in largely the same vein. The game starts off with two kids, Danny and Walter, arguing in their house. Eventually Danny gets tossed into the basement where he finds a board game called Zathura. The brothers start to play the game and the results of their moves turn into real life consequences. As soon after they start playing their house gets tossed into space, they get a huge battle robot, travel to weird planets, and fight huge bosses.

Walter melees with a wrench and throws a variety of projectiles like snowballs and toxic wads. Danny uses a slingshot to do the same projectile attacks, though he has an unlimited amount of his base ammo, called moon rocks. The robot can blast lasers, a charged shot, do a running charge, and jump a lot higher than the two kids.<br /><br />As you guide each character through the game's levels, you'll find each character is presented with specific challenges. For instance, Walter does a few hand over hand sequences, both boys do turret sequences, and the robot just constantly shoots. The problem is there really isn't anything significant that differentiates them beyond this. All the sequences feel almost exactly the same.<br /><br />The other problem is, you don't really need to watch out for enemies or environmental hazards because of the way the game restarts you in a stage after you die. Enemies in Zathura will pop into existence in front of you. Instead of fighting them, it's way more effective to just run right by them. The A.I. is so bad you'll hardly ever get hit in the process. In a few cases we had run past a large group of enemies and eventually gotten killed since a few of them were spitting projectiles at the backs of our heads as they chased us. However, instead of having to restart the sequence, the game respawned us at the end and had wiped away all the enemies leaving us free to continue unharmed as if nothing had happened.<br /><br />A few other instances had us drop into arena-like areas where we assumed we'd have to defeat all the enemies in order to proceed, but this wasn't the case. As the enemies spawned and charged us, we just hopped on a lava turtle and went on to the next area. In The Dead Planet level, all we had to do was run over a hill along the way and groups of five or so enemies would give up chase. Of course, as we were sprinting through groups of enemies we were taking damage, but the ridiculous amount of health powerups made it impractical to be cautious. Enemies killed and the hundreds and hundreds of breakable level objects drop health as well as ammo power ups, so there's never any need to try and be careful. Even the few boss sequences, of which some were admittedly entertaining, particularly the stone goddess fight, gave you enough health to easily last through the battle.<br /><br />\"I Don't Want to Play Anymore, Walter.\"<br /><br />Enemies are not just really dumb, they're spectacularly dumb. In many cases, if you're on a platform and an enemy is on one close to you, they'll walk right at you regardless of whether the platform continues under their feet. In many cases, the outcome is a large number of enemies taking nose dives into pits of lava or other huge crevasses as they topple over the sides of platforms. This was most notable with the fire dogs of Tsouris-3 and the Zorgon warriors. So in some areas, the best strategy isn't to run straight through, but to wait on the edge of a platform while all nearby foes voluntarily plummet into the pit in front of you.<br /><br />The camera is also an issue. Though you're able to control rotate it around, there are times it will lock up. This happened to me on the Robot Planet and was especially notable in the final boss fight, making it very difficult to see what was going on around us. In other cases the camera will switch to a fixed position for some platforming sequences. This is problematic as well since it's extremely difficult to tell exactly where your character is standing and will jump to. It becomes even more of a problem if you're trying to use the game's lock-on system. By itself the system works fairly well, but runs into problems with the inexact camera. The result: lots of unnecessary death. But hey, that's not so bad since sometimes you repawn after the sequence you were trying to pass.<br /><br />Simplistic character models, environments, and level architecture prove that this game's graphics were clearly designed to appeal to children. Character models are big, round, and cartoonish, environments are simple and none of the enemies are particularly scary or frightening (though the Zorgons might be scary to a little kid). Textures are bland and nothing jumps out as particularly detailed or impressive. The framerate is able to remain smooth for most of the game, though occasionally it stutters.<br /><br />Of equal simplicity is the stage design. Each place you go through has you travel from point A to point B along a straightforward path. Often the path through a stage is highlighted by a trail of power ups. Again, more evidence that this is a children's title. What children might not understand is how Zathura advances story. While there are some sequences with an impressive amount of spoken dialogue, there are also a few glaring holes in the game's plot. Your characters will often start a stage and you'll have only vague notions of how they got there. Other times the game will stop in mid battle and go into a cut scene.<br /><br />The music is the best aspect of the game, it's at least somewhat interesting to listen to. Like the cut scenes, however, it too will randomly stop or skip a track when you advance into a new area.<br /><br />Just because Zathura is a kids game doesn't excuse it from needing to be fun to play. The laughable A.I., boring level design, pedestrian graphics, and tattered story make this a game that should be avoided by young and old alike. On top of all that, it's a four hour game at the most and has no multiplayer.", "ParentASIN": "B001ELJPVY", "Timestamp": 1131675555000, "ItemName": "Zathura - Xbox", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 3.8, "RatingCount": 10, "Price": 24.97, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "Xbox Systems", "Xbox", "Games"], "Description": "Play as Walter, Danny, or a rampaging robot, each with unique abilities, to navigate 15 action-packed levels across the universe.

In each of the modes, the task is to turn white tiles black and/or black tiles white, attempting to form horizontal lines of the same hue to remove them from play. To do this, it's all about drawing a line across the tile grid to flip the tiles to their polar opposites; the tiles that lay under the line you've drawn will go from white to black or black to white. Neutral gray titles are a \"free pass\" for players to continue their line without affecting any of the in-play tiles.<br /><br />Polarium's meat is in its individual puzzle designs. There are 100 unique layouts that must be completed by removing all tiles from play in one single stroke of the stylus. Early on it's a cakewalk to find the right path, but about a third of the way into these challenges you'll have to really wrack the brain to see the proper line to draw. The real skill is in seeing how to manipulate both black and white at the same time, not just one or the other. Hints are available when you're stuck; the upper, non-touch screen is used to show the last attempt on the current panel, which is definitely handy as a reference to figure out where you went wrong.<br /><br />What's really slick about this mode is the ability to create and save your own puzzle creations to cartridge. The game makes sure that any design can be solved by challenging the creators to solve it themselves; once it's successful, players can convert that puzzle into an extensive, numerical password so that buddies can pull that puzzle up on their own cartridge. Of course, those puzzles can also be transmitted to anyone's cart provided they're within local wireless range. It's this option that really extends Polarium's staying power.<br /><br />The other half of Polarium is Challenge Mode an attempt to offer a Tetris-style of game design where falling structures move from the upper screen to the lower screen, stacking up when they hit the bottom of the pit. Here, players use their line drawing skills to remove as much of the tiles from play before the stack reaches the top of the bin. The problem: this mode sounds like a winner, but in practice it doesn't come off nearly as well as the Puzzle Mode. The first portion of the game is simply memorizing the particular stacks and drawing the line before they even hit the bottom of the bin. After the first round, the blocks stack up almost arbitrarily, which makes it difficult to play the game the way it was meant to be played.<br /><br />But the blandness of Challenge Mode is rectified with a rather decent multiplayer option using a similar idea. This two player competition pits players one on one, sending completed lines out of their bin into the opposition's. When all of the lines end up in one player's bin, the match is over. It's a hectic matchup that can last a couple of seconds or a few minutes depending on the skills of the player and the luck of the draw in the tile layouts. To add a little bit more to the mayhem, there are power-ups to help or hinder; slowing opponent's sent lines or speeding up your own, for example. The best part: multiplayer only needs one copy of the game, with the owner sending the necessary files over to the cartridge-free system.<br /><br />The problems with Polarium are few but enough to put a dent in the overall production value. The game's control has an overall \"stiff\" feeling due to its reliance on drawing lines that perfectly match the grid-like pattern of the tiles. The responsiveness between drawing the line and \"tapping\" the end to tell the game the line's complete is a bit on the laggy side that gets better with practice, but it's still not as tight as a puzzle game should be. It's a problem that's simply inherent with the game's direction; I can't imagine any better way of controlling Polarium, so \"stiff\" it will always feel.<br /><br />Polarium's minimal presentation, obviously the development team's artistic choice, is certainly interesting and gives the game a look of its own, but its lack of color or graphical flash isn't something easily ignored. It's cool that the developers focused more on gameplay than imagery, but that doesn't mean the package couldn't use just a little more splash of color. We're past the days of grayscale Game Boy, folks.

At very high levels, with equally good players, the difference between winning and losing can come down to milliseconds. Wireless connections have a small amount of overhead (lag), while wired ones essentially do not (it exists, but is too small to make a difference).<br /><br />I like good equipment and enjoy the satisfying feel of a well-built controller, but I'm nowhere near good enough for a wireless connection to make any difference. That's why I've been using the [[ASIN:B00ZDNNRB8 Xbox One Elite Wireless Controller]] for the past two years.<br /><br />Build quality for both is excellent. They have a firm, solid feel in the hand, and exude quality. The Razer has a bit of flair that the Elite lacks. Small differences in the shape, very cool lighting effects and small touches like the way the directional pad has green arrows on it all add up to a great look. The Elite looks like a professional model, but this one looks like it might eat the Elite late at night while nobody is looking.<br /><br />The paddle switches underneath the Elite never worked for me, because they are too easily triggered by accident. Every time I tried them, I ended up with unintentional presses. Eventually, I pulled them off (they are removable) and put them in the case, never to be used again. That's a big problem because a large advantage of the Elite is that it has these extra programmable switches.<br /><br />The switches under the Razer, however, are set more toward the middle of the controller. That makes them a bit harder to press, but also don't get hit by accident. They aren't removable as in the Elite, but they also don't have to be removed because they don't get in the way. For me, this is a huge advantage.<br /><br />The lighting is run to play with and makes me smile, even though it provides no gaming advantage. It can be set to different colors and patterns to mix things up a bit, too. Very fun.<br /><br />There are some extra buttons that the Elite doesn't have on the shoulders that, like the ones underneath, take a little focus to press, but are out of the way otherwise. Another big advantage.<br /><br />The cluster of four round buttons in the upper-right have very little travel. To put it another way, they are hair-trigger buttons. I found this annoying, as it was too easy to press them by accident just by moving my finger over them. It isn't a deal-breaker, but definitely an annoyance.<br /><br />The connecting wire is detachable a short distance from the XBOX USB port. This is a great idea, because the port on the XBOX S is recessed, which makes it difficult to plug something in. With this design, after the cable is plugged in, it can be detached at the breakaway connector instead of the console, which allows me to put the thing away without having the hassle of trying to reach that little port the next time I use it. A great idea. The cable is thick but covered with fabric which keeps it from tangling. This is the best I've seen in a wired connection.<br /><br />This product is great, and a very real alternative to the Elite. Why four stars instead of five? Well, it would be 4 1/2 stars if I could do that, so I rounded down. The remaining half-star is because of the connecting cable. As I said earlier, I'm not good enough that the small lag of a wireless connection matters. The cable is detachable, but this is only for storage. It can't be used wirelessly, which is a big pain point. If it were able to connect both ways, like the Elite, it would be a perfect five stars.<br /><br />Overall, a fantastic controller. Just be aware that It can't do wireless, so if you need that, take a look at the Elite.<br /><br />Sean Logue, 2017", "ParentASIN": "B074RNL1RX", "Timestamp": 1507637281156, "ItemName": "Razer Wolverine Ultimate Officially Licensed Xbox One Controller: 6 Remappable Buttons and Triggers - Interchangeable Thumbsticks and D-Pad - For PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X & S - Black", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.4, "RatingCount": 11192, "Price": 64.98, "Categories": ["Video Games", "PC", "Accessories", "Controllers"], "Description": "The Razer Wolverine Ultimate features interchangeable thumbsticks and D Pads for customizable gameplay, along with extra buttons for advanced gaming.

Because Call of Duty (and its various sequels and spin-offs) is so commercially popular, too many games are now made in a very similar way to attempt to share in the glory (profit). Nothing against COD - I enjoyed it a lot, but I'd like to see some more original FPS games at this point rather than more of the same.<br /><br />I also don't particularly like multi-player games. In the past, there was a &#34;campaign&#34; which is a single-player, scripted experience along with an ability to go out on the cloud servers and fight with other, real players. I can see why people enjoy this, but I like the campaigns best, and tend to ignore the multiplayer stuff. In this one, the multiplayer part is clearly where all the development effort went in, with the &#34;campaign&#34; being little, non-cohesive unsatisfying experiences.<br /><br />But, this is all personal preference. If you like multiplayer games not the campaigns, and love realistic military games like Call of Duty, you will very likely enjoy this one as well. The game, for what it is, is well done.

I enjoyed that, and it did make playing the game seem a little less generic.<br /><br />The choices (like weapon change, weapon reload, etc) were printed on the directional pad as little icons, which would have been great except I can't see them at all. They are not painted, just glossy black on matte black, and I can barely tell they are even there, let alone what they are. If I have to hold them up to a lamp to make them out, it defeats the purpose of having them. That was a disappointing fail.<br /><br />There are two wheels underneath the controller which can be pushed up or down. This essentially gives you four additional buttons. Each one can be programmed on the controller to map to a different button. Pushing up on the right wheel could reload, while pushing up on the left could change weapons, for example. It isn't too hard to do the programming on the controller, but it isn't a nice interface on the console like with the Elite controller, so you'll need to keep the instructions around. It is enough of a pain that you'll probably program them once and leave them that way. Still, these wheels are useful, and unlike the big paddles on the Elite, you probably won't push them by accident. (I had to remove the Elite paddles because I kept hitting them in every game.)<br /><br />The included USB cable is nice and long, but a little stiff.

Just right in all respects.", "Content": "I have several pairs of wireless headsets that I use with my Xbox, but for computer use, wired is simpler, easier, and always works. Enter the Elite Pro from Turtle Beach.<br /><br />These headphones are solid, and built like a tank. They feel as though they could survive a drop from a 3-story building. My guess is they will make it the few feet from your desk to the floor if necessary. Despite their impressive build quality, they are not overly heavy. Not featherweight, by any means, but not heavy.<br /><br />The fit is outstanding. Perhaps the best I've seen on any gaming headphones. This is important to me, because it bugs me when my headphones shift around just because a pencil rolled off my desk and I reached over to grab it. The other reason is because (don't laugh) I have a large head. (Okay, even I laughed just then, so go ahead.) Seriously, my hat size is large, and medium is way too small. Because of this, most headphones, particularly the cheaper ones, which these are not, fit too tightly on my head. That death grip means they get hot and uncomfortable before they should, and pretty soon they are off my head and hanging on their little hanger, unused.<br /><br />These headphones have a feature I haven't seen before, the ability to adjust how tightly they fit on your head. It is controlled by two sliders on the top of the headband, and is easy to adjust, even while wearing them. Why someone hasn't done this before is beyond me. Perhaps all the headphone designers have average-sized heads. I will say that there isn't a lot of difference between their top and bottom settings, though, so they aren't quite as good as they could be.<br /><br />The ear pads are thick, soft, and comfortable. They do a great job at blocking outside noise. This is an area that most headphone makers seem to have focused on, and because of that, they've pretty much perfected it. These have another feature I haven't seen before, too. It is a way for eyeglass stems to comfortably slide under the cushions. Genius! I wear reading glasses while at the computer, so this is a problem for me and many others. The way it works is there is a little adjustment buried under the ear pad covers that pulls the cushion away a little, right where the stems would normally hit. It works well, but because the adjustment is under the covers, you won't want to change it back and forth. Something to be aware of if you only sometimes wear glasses or if you are sharing these with someone else. Overall, though, I'd say it is pretty much perfect. If you never wear glasses, you can leave the adjustment as-is and you'll never notice it is there. If you do use it, there will be a little gap where the eyeglass stems hit that you might notice, especially when not wearing glasses. It is only a small gap, though, so it is unlikely to be an issue either way.<br /><br />The microphone is pretty typical, and does its job. This is one of those areas you only notice when there is a problem with it, and there isn't a problem with these. They use a flexible stem, which is superior to a solid arm because it is easier to adjust.<br /><br />Sound quality overall is excellent. It isn't bass-heavy like a lot of current models, but it isn't too bright and fatiguing, either. A very nice neutral, which makes vocals particularly clear. No complaints on that at all.<br /><br />Price. Well, this is something that is very subjective, as how much they are worth really depends on a lot of personal factors like how important the fit, finish, and sound quality is to you. This model hits it out of the park on all three, but there is a cost for that. In my opinion, they are reasonably priced for what they are. Not inexpensive, by any means, but also not overpriced.

The first one was the original Doom, lo so many years ago. No real puzzles to solve, just visceral and scary. The second one is this game.<br /><br />It is something about the creepy atmosphere, like that of a really good horror movie. This game has it, and before long you're not just watching it, you're in it!<br /><br />The little girl was especially scary, and really added to the suspense. I often didn't know if she was there to help or hurt, but whenever she popped up the hair on the back of my neck went up.<br /><br />The only flaw I found was something that many adventure games have difficulty with, and that is the case where I've missed something and the game grinds to a halt.<br /><br />For example, I'm supposed to crouch down and jump out a window to get to the next area, but I don't see that, and I'm left hanging around with nothing happening while I try to figure out the incomplete step. It doesn't happen very often, but it is worth mentioning. I think it is an unavoidable attribute of any game that has a little complexity to it.<br /><br />The effects are well done, particularly the lighting, water reflections, and smoke. If you want to play this game at a very high resolution or have an older graphics card, it will let you scale down these effects for a good balance between speed and appearance.<br /><br />There is also an expansion pack available. Make sure you don't buy only that one, because the expansion pack will not work without installing the base game first.<br /><br />The controls are fairly standard for a first-person shooter, and use the mouse for easy movement in conjunction with the keyboard for more complex commands.

At very high levels, with equally good players, the difference between winning and losing can come down to milliseconds. Wireless connections have a small amount of overhead (lag), while wired ones essentially do not (it exists, but is too small to make a difference).<br /><br />I like good equipment and enjoy the satisfying feel of a well-built controller, but I'm nowhere near good enough for a wireless connection to make any difference. That's why I've been using the [[ASIN:B00ZDNNRB8 Xbox One Elite Wireless Controller]] for the past two years.<br /><br />Build quality for both is excellent. They have a firm, solid feel in the hand, and exude quality. The Razer has a bit of flair that the Elite lacks. Small differences in the shape, very cool lighting effects and small touches like the way the directional pad has green arrows on it all add up to a great look. The Elite looks like a professional model, but this one looks like it might eat the Elite late at night while nobody is looking.<br /><br />The paddle switches underneath the Elite never worked for me, because they are too easily triggered by accident. Every time I tried them, I ended up with unintentional presses. Eventually, I pulled them off (they are removable) and put them in the case, never to be used again. That's a big problem because a large advantage of the Elite is that it has these extra programmable switches.<br /><br />The switches under the Razer, however, are set more toward the middle of the controller. That makes them a bit harder to press, but also don't get hit by accident. They aren't removable as in the Elite, but they also don't have to be removed because they don't get in the way. For me, this is a huge advantage.<br /><br />The lighting is run to play with and makes me smile, even though it provides no gaming advantage. It can be set to different colors and patterns to mix things up a bit, too. Very fun.<br /><br />There are some extra buttons that the Elite doesn't have on the shoulders that, like the ones underneath, take a little focus to press, but are out of the way otherwise. Another big advantage.<br /><br />The cluster of four round buttons in the upper-right have very little travel. To put it another way, they are hair-trigger buttons. I found this annoying, as it was too easy to press them by accident just by moving my finger over them. It isn't a deal-breaker, but definitely an annoyance.<br /><br />The connecting wire is detachable a short distance from the XBOX USB port. This is a great idea, because the port on the XBOX S is recessed, which makes it difficult to plug something in. With this design, after the cable is plugged in, it can be detached at the breakaway connector instead of the console, which allows me to put the thing away without having the hassle of trying to reach that little port the next time I use it. A great idea. The cable is thick but covered with fabric which keeps it from tangling. This is the best I've seen in a wired connection.<br /><br />This product is great, and a very real alternative to the Elite. Why four stars instead of five? Well, it would be 4 1/2 stars if I could do that, so I rounded down. The remaining half-star is because of the connecting cable. As I said earlier, I'm not good enough that the small lag of a wireless connection matters. The cable is detachable, but this is only for storage. It can't be used wirelessly, which is a big pain point. If it were able to connect both ways, like the Elite, it would be a perfect five stars.<br /><br />Overall, a fantastic controller. Just be aware that It can't do wireless, so if you need that, take a look at the Elite.<br /><br />Sean Logue, 2017", "ParentASIN": "B074RNL1RX", "Timestamp": 1507637281156, "ItemName": "Razer Wolverine Ultimate Officially Licensed Xbox One Controller: 6 Remappable Buttons and Triggers - Interchangeable Thumbsticks and D-Pad - For PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X & S - Black", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.4, "RatingCount": 11192, "Price": 64.98, "Categories": ["Video Games", "PC", "Accessories", "Controllers"], "Description": "The Razer Wolverine Ultimate features interchangeable thumbsticks and D Pads for customizable gameplay, along with extra buttons including remappable Multi Function bumpers and triggers.

Because Call of Duty (and its various sequels and spin-offs) is so commercially popular, too many games are now made in a very similar way to attempt to share in the glory (profit). Nothing against COD - I enjoyed it a lot, but I'd like to see some more original FPS games at this point rather than more of the same.<br /><br />I also don't particularly like multi-player games. In the past, there was a &#34;campaign&#34; which is a single-player, scripted experience along with an ability to go out on the cloud servers and fight with other, real players. I can see why people enjoy this, but I like the campaigns best, and tend to ignore the multiplayer stuff. In this one, the multiplayer part is clearly where all the development effort went in, with the &#34;campaign&#34; being little, non-cohesive unsatisfying experiences.<br /><br />But, this is all personal preference. If you like multiplayer games not the campaigns, and love realistic military games like Call of Duty, you will very likely enjoy this one as well. The game, for what it is, is well done.

I enjoyed that, and it did make playing the game seem a little less generic.<br /><br />The choices (like weapon change, weapon reload, etc) were printed on the directional pad as little icons, which would have been great except I can't see them at all. They are not painted, just glossy black on matte black, and I can barely tell they are even there, let alone what they are. If I have to hold them up to a lamp to make them out, it defeats the purpose of having them. That was a disappointing fail.<br /><br />There are two wheels underneath the controller which can be pushed up or down. This essentially gives you four additional buttons. Each one can be programmed on the controller to map to a different button. Pushing up on the right wheel could reload, while pushing up on the left could change weapons, for example. It isn't too hard to do the programming on the controller, but it isn't a nice interface on the console like with the Elite controller, so you'll need to keep the instructions around. It is enough of a pain that you'll probably program them once and leave them that way. Still, these wheels are useful, and unlike the big paddles on the Elite, you probably won't push them by accident.

Just right in all respects.", "Content": "I have several pairs of wireless headsets that I use with my Xbox, but for computer use, wired is simpler, easier, and always works. Enter the Elite Pro from Turtle Beach.<br /><br />These headphones are solid, and built like a tank. They feel as though they could survive a drop from a 3-story building. My guess is they will make it the few feet from your desk to the floor if necessary. Despite their impressive build quality, they are not overly heavy. Not featherweight, by any means, but not heavy.<br /><br />The fit is outstanding. Perhaps the best I've seen on any gaming headphones. This is important to me, because it bugs me when my headphones shift around just because a pencil rolled off my desk and I reached over to grab it. The other reason is because (don't laugh) I have a large head. (Okay, even I laughed just then, so go ahead.) Seriously, my hat size is large, and medium is way too small. Because of this, most headphones, particularly the cheaper ones, which these are not, fit too tightly on my head. That death grip means they get hot and uncomfortable before they should, and pretty soon they are off my head and hanging on their little hanger, unused.<br /><br />These headphones have a feature I haven't seen before, the ability to adjust how tightly they fit on your head. It is controlled by two sliders on the top of the headband, and is easy to adjust, even while wearing them. Why someone hasn't done this before is beyond me. Perhaps all the headphone designers have average-sized heads. I will say that there isn't a lot of difference between their top and bottom settings, though, so they aren't quite as good as they could be.<br /><br />The ear pads are thick, soft, and comfortable. They do a great job at blocking outside noise. This is an area that most headphone makers seem to have focused on, and because of that, they've pretty much perfected it. These have another feature I haven't seen before, too. It is a way for eyeglass stems to comfortably slide under the cushions. Genius! I wear reading glasses while at the computer, so this is a problem for me and many others. The way it works is there is a little adjustment buried under the ear pad covers that pulls the cushion away a little, right where the stems would normally hit. It works well, but because the adjustment is under the covers, you won't want to change it back and forth. Something to be aware of if you only sometimes wear glasses or if you are sharing these with someone else. Overall, though, I'd say it is pretty much perfect. If you never wear glasses, you can leave the adjustment as-is and you'll never notice it is there. If you do use it, there will be a little gap where the eyeglass stems hit that you might notice, especially when not wearing glasses. It is only a small gap, though, so it is unlikely to be an issue either way.<br /><br />The microphone is pretty typical, and does its job. This is one of those areas you only notice when there is a problem with it, and there isn't a problem with these. They use a flexible stem, which is superior to a solid arm because it is easier to adjust.<br /><br />Sound quality overall is excellent. It isn't bass-heavy like a lot of current models, but it isn't too bright and fatiguing, either. A very nice neutral, which makes vocals particularly clear. No complaints on that at all.<br /><br />Price. Well, this is something that is very subjective, as how much they are worth really depends on a lot of personal factors like how important the fit, finish, and sound quality is to you. This model hits it out of the park on all three, but there is a cost for that. In my opinion, they are reasonably priced for what they are. Not inexpensive, by any means, but also not overpriced.

I often didn't know if she was there to help or hurt, but whenever she popped up the hair on the back of my neck went up.<br /><br />The only flaw I found was something that many adventure games have difficulty with, and that is the case where I've missed something and the game grinds to a halt.<br /><br />For example, I'm supposed to crouch down and jump out a window to get to the next area, but I don't see that, and I'm left hanging around with nothing happening while I try to figure out the incomplete step. It doesn't happen very often, but it is worth mentioning. I think it is an unavoidable attribute of any game that has a little complexity to it.<br /><br />The effects are well done, particularly the lighting, water reflections, and smoke. If you want to play this game at a very high resolution or have an older graphics card, it will let you scale down these effects for a good balance between speed and appearance.<br /><br />There is also an expansion pack available. Make sure you don't buy only that one, because the expansion pack will not work without installing the base game first.<br /><br />The controls are fairly standard for a first-person shooter, and use the mouse for easy movement in conjunction with the keyboard for more complex commands. I didn't find it hard to navigate through at all, which is great because sometimes three dimensional games can make the simple act of walking difficult.<br /><br />There are also plenty of cheat codes available with a quick Google search in case you get stuck and decide you need one. Some folks don't like them, which is fine, but I tend to use them when I get stuck as I think it is better than just turning it off and not finishing the game.<br /><br />If you like first person shooters with atmosphere and a good back story, this is the game for you!<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Sean P.

All they did was place the game and code slip inside the standard PS4 boxing, then add a paper slip cover around it with the GTA artwork pictured.<br /><br />Be aware that about 90BG of the hard drive are reserved for system updates and the like, so storage capacity is nearly 20% less than I'd expected.  Full games can range from a bit over 20GB for Injustice: Gods Among Us to just over 50GB for GTA V.  Long story short, expect it to fill up pretty fast.  If you're hoping to have dozens of games on it at once you're going to need to buy a bigger drive.  Personally I never play more than 5-10 at any stretch and can deal with removing some and re-installing later.<br /><br />You know what the PS4 is by now and what it does, so I'll just say that I do see a substantial yet not jaw dropping boost in graphics compared to PS3.  Games still have jagged edges, narrow surfaces like guard rails flicker when the camera moves, and titles like The Evil Within don't bother to take advantage of the hardware's abilities.  It's not the dramatic difference that came with gaming in HD for the first time last gen.  The DualShock 4 controller is very comfortable, quite possibly the best controller I've ever used.  It's a lot of fun to have the built in speaker be the output for the GTA cell phone, the built in headphone jack is convenient, and the light bar doesn't reflect enough off my black bezel TV to be a problem, nor does it light up a dark room in a way that would hurt atmosphere in horror games.  The options and share buttons are indented to be impossible to push by accident, and the touch pad seems responsive for what little use it has had so far.

I've been a fighter enthusiast as long as the genre has existed, but am a decidedly average player.  The first time I put the game in, I chose a character and tried the arcade mode on normal and was pretty thoroughly destroyed.  Then I decided it would be best to have patience and do the lengthy tutorials.  The difference was night and day after that, as I went on to stomp arcade mode on normal including several perfect rounds.<br /><br />In the 20+ years since Street Fighter 2 first put fighting games on the map, this may be the most intuitive, user friendly interface I've seen.  The face buttons are designated A,B,C & D, and combos flow very naturally once you learn to start with one of those letters for an attack and progress alphabetically to string hits together (such as hitting A A B down-B C, etc.), plus of course mixing in special attacks where possible.  It's the perfect case of &#34;easy to learn, difficult to master&#34;, as there are multiple meters to fill which give you added offensive and defensive abilities when called upon, such as increased damage, powerful special attacks only available when you have enough meter, and the ability to break an opponent's combo and send them far across the screen so you can regroup.  The balance is excellent in that meters take long enough to fill that people can't just spam these things in lieu of fighting well, it's there for aggression or to bail you out when close to defeat.  There's even a spectacular finish called Astral Heat you can trigger for the win under certain conditions, with a wildly flashy and satisfying set of animations unique to each character.  There are no projectile attacks, as the game is about positioning and when to strike or counter, not players spamming fireballs that cancel each other 50 times straight (no offense SF).<br /><br />The characters are wild, including a cat person, a blob type creature, a bionic woman, and one that looks VERY feminine but is actually a man.  There's great variety in fighting styles and moveset as well as appearance, making this a game that's very easy to get lost in.  Each character has six different palette choices so you won't bore of looking at your favorite.  And yes, some of the female characters are hyper-sexualized, but certainly nothing you'd have to shield a child's eyes from.  I for one don't mind a librarian who looks like Bayonetta one bit.<br /><br />Graphics and sound are of very high quality, with the visuals never suffering the slightest hiccup.  No drops in framerate or slowdown, and best of all even long combos look like a human delivering strikes, not a crazy blur where you can't even see what's happening.  Even the flashy, colorful special attacks never obstruct your view so you can still effectively time your blocks and counters.<br /><br />It's no easy task making a fighting game that can appeal to tournament level players while still being fun for novices, but BlazBlue Chrono Phantasma delivers.

There is enough variety in special powers to set it apart from earlier Bioshock games.  Personally I preferred being able to summon a murder of crows to swarm groups of enemies.  The guns are numerous but you can only carry two and some are far better than others.  I found the skylines disorienting and virtually impossible to use during battle, which is a massive problem during the final battle.<br /><br />Songbird is never a boss enemy at any point and only shows up a handful of times, a far lesser role than I'd expected.  Elizabeth never has to be defended, is good at not physically being in the way, and feels like a very complete character who I grew to like and care about.  There are racial overtones throughout but nothing near as bad as I expected given some reviews.  1912 was the Gilded Age and that theme is hammered on a good bit.<br /><br />Unfortunately the last 5% of this game left a very sour taste in my mouth.  The last battle is of a defend the fort variety where you have to take out waves of enemies before they deplete the health meter of the airship you're on.  I despise final battles that feel nothing like anything that happened during the game, and this one was so bad I almost switched to easy to get through.  It doesn't help that you're deliberately starved of ammo; more than once I was completely out and utterly helpless.

Start to finish Tomb Raider pushes the hardware to its limit, dazzles with great story telling and gameplay, and is a clearly finished product that every gamer must experience.<br /><br />Graphics:<br /><br />Lara looks amazing; beautiful and sexy but still like a real person (to be blunt she has C-cups in this game).  The backdrops are many and look stunning, the weather effects are the best I've seen, especially wind, there are no issues like pop-in or collision detection, it all looks outstanding.  Lara puts her hands on walls as she navigates around them, clutches at a fresh cutscene wound, and otherwise does countless subtle things that add realism.<br /><br />Sound:<br /><br />Finally a game that shows what my 5.1 surround system can do.  Atmospheric noises from stumbling through shallow water to creaking and cracking as ruins are strained to an outstanding orchestral score, the sound creates the perfect mood.  The gunshots are loud and very realistic, giving my sub woofer a workout.  It's beyond me why other games don't have gunfire like this.<br /><br />Far and away the best part of the sound is the voice acting, particularly Lara's.  She has a beautiful British accent, conveys emotions well, and her breathing can be very labored when appropriate.  After an especially nasty sequence ending in a hard tumble and wound, her breath even squeaks as she tries to keep it together.  She starts the game inexperienced and afraid, and as things get rough and she has to begin taking lives to save her own, she toughens up little by little.  I can't commend the studio enough for being so gradual and believable with Lara's maturation through the course of the game.  It would have been so easy to make a stereotypical \"strong woman\" who didn't flinch in the face of mortal danger and friends dying, but Lara always acts how a real person would thrust into chaos for the first time.  Other characters are all solid but don't get that much dialogue, save for Matthias, whose voice is perfect for his role.<br /><br />Story:<br /><br />I don't want to spoil anything, so let's just say the story involves getting shipwrecked on an island and trying to find a way off, learning along the way that something unnatural is going on and leaving is not as easy as securing transportation.  Lara has close friends as well as acquaintances she merely tolerates during the expedition.  She routinely communicates with them with a walkie talkie, which allows for a lot of character development.  It's so much fun hearing her friends tell her to seek shelter and just stay alive early on, having to reassure her regularly, only to talk her down from being too adventurous later as she becomes battle tested and gains more nerve.  Most of the game is spent with the theme \"something about this place isn't right\" as opposed to constantly waving the supernatural at the player.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /><br />95% of the combat involves battling human enemies, who are fairly intelligent about taking cover and working together to take Lara out.  Lara gets several weapons during the game and can add many upgrades to all of them like steadier aim, faster reload, longer clips and secondary functions.  I fell in love with her bow and arrow right away, with its heavy damage but slower speed to target.  Flame tipped arrows that create a pool of fire became my favorite weapon.  There is no auto-aim but it isn't needed as the controls are very precise.  There are also many skills Lara learns by experience points you get to spend in the many camps which are set throughout the game.  Dodging melee attacks and counter striking is satisfying, as are the executions you can initiate on a stunned enemy.  As has been said, some of the sequences when Lara dies are very gruesome, and are exponentially more effective because Lara is a character I grew to care for and wanted to keep safe.  The platforming is very good provided you look before you leap.  On occasion I didn't jump from one ledge to the one I meant to, but that's thanks to the analog sticks being so much less precise than a d-pad, which is only used here to select weapons.  There are tons of hidden items to collect to unlock various artwork and videos, including treasure maps that show where they're hidden.  The optional tombs are always worth doing, and are challenging to solve but not excessively so.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />Tomb Raider takes the best elements of Uncharted, graphics and voice acting as good as Arkham City, shooting controls that are always precise and intuitive, creative puzzle elements, very solid platforming that never leads to frustration, and makes a game that's an early contender for game of the year.  I urge everyone reading this to buy it immediately; you will have a great time and it's so important to reward a studio and publisher for putting forth the effort to make a polished, outstanding new game and not one more sequel or FPS.

Your right hand wields a sword (or dagger for stealth kills), while your left either holds a crossbow or gun or uses supernatural powers, which are shamelessly taken from Bioshock right down to using blue vials to regenerate power.  Several times during the game I absent mindedly tried to switch to telekinesis to claim out of reach objects (that particular power isn't here).  The ability to summon a rat swarm just like the Bioshock bee swarm is another total ripoff.<br /><br />I chose to be stealthy to get the good ending (no spoilers) and it's a huge hassle.  I'd say a good 25% of the time I tried to choke a guard out from behind for a nonlethal takedown it didn't work, Corvo swinging his dagger a few inches in front of him instead.  On several occasions it meant getting spotted.  Once that happens you pretty much have to reload your last save because it's impossible to evade the guards; they run as fast as you and often still see you if you use the blink ability to teleport away.  Sleep darts are in your arsenal but you can only carry ten max to ensure you have to deal with this frustration.  Incidentally, the \"good\" ending is brief and completely not worth the effort.  They don't even bother to explain how the rat plague that's the theme of the entire game comes to an end.<br /><br />You could try to Rambo your way through, but the guards come in numbers and have pistols that take a great deal of health from you.  The lethal options are very standard FPS stuff anyway.<br /><br />While the graphics are solid and bugs are almost nonexistent (the occasional guard getting stuck to something), this just isn't a very fun game and you don't have the freedom to choose your own play style as had been suggested.

I love Globox and would actually make him the star.<br /><br />Anyway, the graphics are as good as any 2D game I've ever seen, the sound is top notch, and the overall presentation is polished.  The bosses look phenomenal, though there's an odd mix of high difficulty and simple strategy in beating them.  The concept of collecting Lums as a sort of point system didn't really work for me.  It felt artificial to try making certain jumps to get enough of them to unlock Electoons and advance to the later levels.<br /><br />The platforming in this game ranges from moderately difficult to utterly insane.  There were times when it reminded me of Battletoads for the NES, one of the hardest games ever made.  The optional levels that feature chasing down treasure chests are particularly old-school in that they require absolute precision and lots of trial and error deaths before you figure out how to get through.  Ultimately I did beat this game including every treasure chest and the extra tough-as-nails stage that unlocks.  It just took some mental recalibration after years of being coddled by easy games.<br /><br />The variety in level design is enough to keep the game interesting, and I personally favored the swimming levels and side-scrolling shooter stages over the straight platforming.  The game is very colorful, to the point that when you're not in peril it's nice to just stop and admire the scenery.  I never had it crash, but occasionally I got unfairly \"jammed\" by a wall or corner I visibly cleared during a jump and died.  Thankfully the demand of absolute precision comes fairly late in the game and doesn't ruin the experience.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun game, but the cute and fuzzy creatures shouldn't fool anyone into expecting an easy or even moderate challenge.  If you want to show your kids what a hard game actually is, this is the place to start.  I never wanted to throw my controller, but I kept thinking back to some of the hardest games I've ever beaten to reassure myself I could overcome this one.

The sound is also nearly as good as GOW3.<br /><br />I have now played every game in the series, and these titles stack up well.  They are lacking in truly epic boss battles, which is understandable since the main story was saved for the console releases.  Still, what's here is solid, and also very familiar.  You have the obligatory moment of Kratos on a ship, treasure chests hidden in the foreground, an occasional cheap death via some trap that only seems to exist to aggravate you, unwelcome beam walking (thankfully held to a minimum), and of course the absence of all your previously earned weapons and life/magic meter extensions to start every game.  In the case of Ghost of Sparta, they don't even contrive a way to power you down.  You are a god, yet weak enough to be killed by standard enemies.  I just find it absurd that in the entire series I never felt like I wielded the power of the god of war.  Remember when Ares wiped out an entire barbarian army at will?  Why can't Kratos do that?  At least Ghost of Sparta offers the option to use the Arms of Sparta, a spear and shield that I enjoyed using as Kratos' main weapons to break up the monotony of his chain blades, which have never felt powerful to me.<br /><br />In conclusion, this series has gotten quite stale over the course of five games, but this release is well worth your time if you enjoyed the others.

Thankfully, Arkham City keeps all the good elements of the first game, makes some improvements, and adds enough new elements that the experience still feels fresh.<br /><br />The one major downside to Arkham Asylum to me was the need to almost constantly use the X-ray vision mode to see where thugs were lurking around corners in order to plan stealth attacks in relatively small spaces.  This time around, the city environment allows for much greater movement, and the lighting makes it easy to see enemies without going to X-ray mode, while still keeping a dark atmosphere.  Strategy is still needed since some of the bad guys carry guns, but I no longer feel like I'm playing the role of a ninja, taking out one guy and scurrying back into the shadows.  It's very cool to look to the sky and see the bat-signal indicating the direction of your current primary objective.<br /><br />The number of melee attacks you can unlock is so extensive it felt overwhelming at first.  Fortunately you have the option to have a prompt come up at the bottom of the screen when your combo meter is high enough to use advanced attacks.  The more sophisticated and varied your fighting style, the more XP points you get to unlock more abilities and upgrade your armor.<br /><br />Then there are the hundreds of Riddler trophies to obtain.  Some are merely hidden from sight, while others are in plain view but require solving a puzzle to free them for collection.  There is even a device that involves chaining letters together to form words to solve some of the riddles.  There are also various challenges like gliding a certain distance, performing certain attacks successfully, and destroying Joker teeth, each of which awards a Riddler trophy.  Just collecting all the trophies is like a game in itself, and is a nice way to break up the action.  Also, you can hold down the L2 button to mark a Riddler trophy on your map if you can't currently retrieve it.  Tip: If there is no evident way to get to a trophy, mark it and move on.  Many require gadgets that you may not have yet, and the red ones can only be obtained by Catwoman.<br /><br />Catwoman has really nice martial arts attacks, can use her whip and other weapons, and can make repeated jumps to scale a building in place of Batman's grappling hook.  She definitely feels fully developed and in no way tacked on as a promotional gimmick.<br /><br />Batman's gliding ability combined with being able to grapple from midair makes it easy to get around the city.  It's fun, the physics are well done, and it is practically useful.<br /><br />The graphics in this game are some of the best I've ever seen.  I never have that sensation like in some sandbox games where the buildings look painted into the background and unrealistic.  It really feels like a living, breathing world, especially since there are always optional side missions popping up and bad guys lurking and chatting about what's going on.  The voice acting is very good, especially Mark Hamill's portrayal of The Joker.<br /><br />AI in this game is impressive.  If I take out one in a gang with stealth and the others find him, they go on alert and actively search.  This means altering their patrol patterns, staying closer together, and turning around much more often to watch their backs.  It's a refreshing change from games where guys go on alert for a minute, then return to mindlessly walking the exact same path and begging to be picked off.  The game is challenging but never cheap, and if you have trouble with certain elements of fighting you can upgrade accordingly.  The ability to throw down a smoke pellet when coming under gunfire is a great addition.<br /><br />I don't have a bad thing to say about this game.  I'm not one to go overboard with praise and ignore flaws, but there are no issues here.  No bugs, no collision detection problems, no slowdown despite the huge scale of the city, no painful logic gaps in the story or motivation.  You can tell Rocksteady had a great engine to start with, and spent their time fixing issues and expanding gameplay in creative ways.  Too often I get frustrated during a game and wonder \"didn't the developers care if this is actually fun to play?\".  During the many hours I've spent in Arkham City, I have only asked that once, which was when I was first learning how to glide.  There is no tutorial and I had to go online to figure out how to dive and pull up.  That temporary problem aside, the game is nonstop fun, with enough challenge that I've died numerous times in ways that left me saying \"I need to plan better next time\".

It slows them in mid-air to set up skillshots and aim them for environmental kills.  The skillshots are many and some are easy to pull off while others demand precision or require certain conditions like something to impale an enemy on or getting two or more lined up to take out at once.<br /><br />There are unique weapons like the flail gun and drill that add variety to the gameplay, and each weapon can eventually have a charge shot added to it that does something different than the normal blast, such as the pistol having a flare shot that sets an enemy ablaze or sniper bullets that can be detonated on command once you have guided one into a target, allowing you to blow up him and any nearby enemies all at once, with all multi-enemy kills giving point bonuses.  When you fire the sniper rifle, you get a behind the camera view of the bullet in flight and control its path with the right stick, meaning you can even hit enemies hiding behind cover.<br /><br />There's a decent level of variety in the enemies, and the stages also change up just enough to allow numerous types of environmental kills.

Dodge an enemy attack and awkwardly counter before he swings again.  In the first game Sly has to shimmy to get across wires despite being a raccoon!  The platforming in these games is consistently awkward and imprecise.  At one stretch they took to having you push the circle button to make Sly automatically land on the proper jump points.  The whole thing is just clumsy, repetitive, and light years behind Ratchet & Clank (even the PS2 games).  The non-platforming stages include cliches like having to win a race and manning a turret gun to cover your ally as he tries to retrieve a key you need to advance.  They felt as if I had played them before and were not fun at all.<br /><br />I got less than half way through Sly 1, tried to get into Sly 2, but have now given up.

The t-shirt is good quality and fits as any large shirt would.  I only saw it in the game once though, so it almost seems like an afterthought.  The boxers are pretty straightforward.  The pillowcase is quite a nice visual, though depending on your age I don't know who you'd want to actually see it on your bed.  It would be at home in a game room.  The \"pizza box\" isn't really a big deal.  The music CD has 11 tracks from the game and is the best bonus item to me.  The art book doesn't have as much art as I'd like, but it's still interesting to look through and includes some insight to the creation of the game's visuals.  As I write this the deluxe edition is only $10 more than the regular one, and that's definitely a deal.<br /><br />Catherine game review:<br /><br />The main character Vincent is 32 years old, and his girlfriend Katherine is starting to get anxious about where things are going.  It's your standard \"we're age X so we're supposed to want Y\" situation.  He isn't sure about marriage and kids, so he gets very drunk with his friends and wakes up with Catherine, the young hottie who wants things to be casual... at first.<br /><br />In terms of story, most of the game is spent at The Stray Sheep, a bar/diner.  Vincent has to decide how to handle his infidelity, which leaves you making numerous decisions that directly affect the story, and lead toward any of eight possible endings.  It becomes a sort of personality quiz as you answer questions based on what you would do in your own life.  The game even accumulates players' answers online and shows you how others answered.  What's interesting is there is not an obvious \"right\" or \"wrong\" answer to questions.  You're much better served being honest and seeing where the game takes you than artificially trying to get the \"good ending\".  Other characters in the game are developed enough that Vincent can have some meaningful back and forth chats which sometimes influence the mysterious meter that determines his behavior in cutscenes.<br /><br />The block puzzles that make up the gameplay are fun, challenging, and have enough variety that it doesn't get repetitive.  There are normal blocks, ice blocks that you slip on, traps, exploding blocks, some that are immovable, springboard blocks that send you skyward, etc.  In some stages you also find yourself racing against time as a monster of Vincent's nightmares chases you.  I can't spoil anything, so I'll just say they are varied and really cool.  As you progress, you are given tips on techniques you can use to scale the towers you must climb to stay alive, since if you die in the dream world where the action takes place, you die for real.  I have beaten the game once on easy, and that presented a significant challenge.  In essence you will be forced to learn and improve to advance.  If you're bad at puzzle games you should still be able to get through on easy, especially since you get checkpoints and lots of continues.  You can also play the Rapunzel arcade game in the Stray Sheep to practice your skills.  The Rapunzel levels are more like traditional puzzles where there's no time crunch and you have to think hard to figure out how to advance.<br /><br />Don't be afraid of this game!  I know you've heard so much about how hard it is that you may be scared, but there's nothing here you can't get through with a bit of practice.  I felt a sense of accomplishment when I beat it and am looking forward to the challenge that the normal setting will bring, as well as the chance to see how different decisions will affect the story.  Never once did I want to throw my controller in frustration.  When I died it was due to getting panicked and either making bad moves or forgetting techniques.  You can't lounge about but you have more time to find a way upward than it feels like.  There are even coins to pick up and rest stops to buy helpful items if you can't hack it and don't care about achieving a gold award for beating a level without such help and manage to grab enough of the coins placed throughout the stage, often in out-of-the-way places.  There's also an \"undo\" button that lets you take back your last move if you realize you just sabotaged your own advancement.<br /><br />Catherine is creative, unique and lots of fun, and I'm very glad to have rewarded Atlus for showing the courage to make something different.  With such big replay value, I'll be coming back to this game for months on end, so it is well worth full price.

I'm glad to say it has lived up to my expectations.  Over 80 reviews are already up, so I'll skip the plot and go straight to the gameplay.<br /><br />There's a lot of platform jumping in this game, which is free of frustration thanks to Alice's double jumping and gliding abilities.  If you do miss a moving platform or otherwise plunge to your death, you won't have to sit through a loading screen.  Alice screams as she falls, then a moment later you are returned to the last place you had solid footing.  There are no frustrating do-overs in this game at all.  There's also no backtracking worth mentioning.  If you do get stuck, you can use Alice's shrink vision, which lets her see everything from clues to invisible platforms that let her advance, as well as gaining the ability to pass through keyholes to access secret areas.<br /><br />In addition to platforming, there are many hidden areas and goodies throughout the game.  It reminded me of finding invisible 1-up boxes in Super Mario Bros. back in the day.  You are rewarded for exploring with \"memories\" of Alice as she tries to piece her mind back together.  These memories are quotes from people in her life and gradually help fill in the story.  They are hidden creatively or placed on a high platform you must find a way to reach.  Looking for them is actually part of the fun rather than being a shallow way to extend the game.  Hidden areas also have \"teeth\", which are the currency used to upgrade your weapons.<br /><br />The game itself is quite long but never feels tedious.  While it takes a while for variation in enemies to show up, each of the six chapters has a very unique style about it, and Alice's outfit even changes to complement them.  For $2 you can download DLC of extra outfits, each of which are very cool looking with lots of detail, and each also gives her some extra power, as well as upgraded weapons.  I played the game on normal and while strategy is needed, I never felt overwhelmed.  You can hold L1 to target enemies, and I never had any meaningful camera issues.  Thankfully you also cannot be nudged off ledges during combat, nor do combo attacks send you to any cheap deaths.  The designers really managed to make this game \"accessible\" without it being insultingly easy.<br /><br />I won't recap the story or spoil anything, so let's just say it's dark and earns its mature rating.  This is most certainly not drawn from the animated Disney version of Alice in Wonderland I grew up with.  There's a bit of cursing and some blood, but honestly I think anyone teen and up could play it without being traumatized; none of the enemies in the game are even human.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you like good platforming, lots of hidden areas to find, a few light puzzles, solid combat, a compelling story and creativity at every turn, this is a must own.  I have finished the game once and never experienced a single bug, glitch or crash.  If you're deciding between this and some other game, go with Alice.

I pretty much abandoned the franchise after that...until now.<br /><br />The graphics in this game are excellent, as is the sound.  I haven't seen a single bug or glitch of any kind.  In terms of depth, combat here is much closer to Soul Calibur than the old MK games where you mostly spammed special moves and attempted jump-kick based combos.  Each character has their own combos with certain button sequences, just like their special moves.  Button mashers will not last long in this game.<br /><br />Characters have been individually developed as opposed to being little more than palette swaps like the ninjas of the old series.  Many of the special attacks make me cringe with their brutality, and the new X-ray meter is very well implemented.  It is gradually filled by landing combos, using special attacks and when you take damage.  Being rewarded for taking damage sounded dubious at first, but it turns out to merely balance out a lopsided fight rather than giving a cheap NBA Jam style comeback opportunity.  The X-ray bar has three sections.  As it fills, you can use one section for a boosted special attack, two sections for a combo breaker, or all three for the devastating X-ray attack, which looks incredibly cool and is unique for each fighter.  Better still, it can be blocked or avoided, so there's strategy in deciding whether to use it and risk draining your meter with nothing to show for it.  Then there are the fatalities, some of which have left my mouth agape with their sheer gore, and that's coming from someone desensitized by years of slasher films.  No more blowing someone up and seeing six gray legs fall to the ground.  The kills are very detailed and many include numerous gratuitous acts after the initial blow would clearly be fatal.<br /><br />There is a challenge tower which awards \"kombat points\" for completing tasks like landing so many strikes in a time limit, avoiding taking damage for 15 seconds, or landing specific attacks from a checklist in the corner of the screen.  These kombat points unlock extra fatalities (you only get one per character at first) as well as kombat codes to do things like disable throws or have quick uppercut recovery, as well as unlocking various artwork.  There are hundreds of unlockables and you don't know which you'll get, so it should make for hours of play to see everything.  There's also a story mode which is quite long and fun because it establishes the characters and their motivations.  There's also a tag team mode which lets you switch between characters during a fight.  There are even tag team moves in which your partner momentarily comes onto the screen for a specific attack that can be worked into your combos.<br /><br />This game has a level of depth, polish and imagination beyond anything I had hoped for.  It's the sort of thing where once you buy it, you better have a LOT of free time.  Anyone who was hesitant because it might be a disappointing game, or have bugs at launch as so many titles now do, fear not.  This is a finished product and is so high in quality that Midway should be embarrassed they didn't produce it when they had the chance.  Netherrealm Studios has taken the ball and run with it.  Non-gamers will of course use it to bash gamers and say they just enjoy mindless violence, but that's exactly what it is not.  In fact story mode doesn't even allow fatalities (they need the characters to stick around a while) and I hardly miss them thanks to the depth of the gameplay.  With the old MK games, fatalities were the reward for putting up with shallow play.  Now the fatalities are more of a footnote, with emphasis on exploring the deep combo system.

The camera follows the ball very well so you can easily see what's happening, and zooms out in multi-ball for the same effect.  There are a good number of tables and all are fun to play.  There's even a tutorial for each table with narration and arrows used to point to goals and bonuses, which for a few complex tables is greatly helpful.  Knowing what actions trigger what events adds a depth I never fully appreciated with real pinball.  The physics are amazingly real, the dual-shock kicks in at the right times, and you can use the left stick to \"shake\" the table.  For the tables that include an LCD display on the top part of the machine, the relevant display shows in the upper left corner of your screen and never blocks your view of the action.  It all works so well it leaves me wondering why no one did this sooner.  I hope there's a second edition or DLC with even more tables, and that other pinball machine makers follow this blueprint.

It's simply a gothic God of War with aggravating platforming and puzzles that aren't really puzzles at all.<br /><br />The graphics in this game are a mixed bag.  They look decent, but the framerate is so choppy it reminded me of GTA3.  There's no slowdown, but all the movement just looks unnatural.  The sound effects are nothing special at all, and one of the bosses kept spamming the same taunt so many times I wanted to throw my controller right through the TV.<br /><br />The combat is a straight GOW clone, with points having to be earned to level up your weapon so you can attempt to use combo attacks.  Too bad all but the simplest of enemies block repeatedly so it's nearly impossible to ever land one.  Mind you, I beat Ninja Gaiden Sigma, so I have no issues with games that feature complex combat and a high level of difficulty.  Also on the GOW ripoff front, one of your weapons is a gauntlet.  One stage even has ruins that look like Greece.  When I wasn't gritting my teeth over my endlessly blocked attacks, I was constantly moving to get the enemies back on screen since the camera is terrible.  As if this game isn't derivative enough, some of the bosses are actually called Titans.  They didn't even attempt to be original.  The start to one of those battles involved just running around at a distance like an idiot for a full minute before you can finally do anything.  I can't convey enough how stupid the boss battles are in this game.  When you're not climbing up some gigantic creature, you're running from whatever imps are there to annoy you so you can't hit a boss more than once or twice without taking damage.  Wouldn't want to actually be able to use any of those combos you spent points on, would you?  Striking an enemy does NOT keep it from attacking, so unless it has just missed an attack and has its back to you, you'll never land more than two hits without taking damage.<br /><br />I also found myself cursing over not being able to advance.  This wasn't because the puzzles are too hard, but because they are nearly invisible within the game environment.  I spent lots of time scratching my head and attempting to make a jump when the whole time there was a ledge or something to hook my chain to that I just didn't see.  Objects that you're supposed to interact with glow, but not always.  At one point I had to remove the handle from one wheel to use on another.  The problem?  The wheel blended right in with the wall in the room it was in and did not glow.  After 20 minutes of circling through the entire level repeatedly, I resorted to a walkthrough and was furious to find out the solution, one I NEVER would have spotted and required no thought to \"solve\".<br /><br />Then there are the platforming elements, which are entirely unnecessary as they add nothing to the gameplay and don't work well at all.  When holding onto a ledge, half the time pushing the analog stick does not send Gabriel in the right direction.  Several times instead of moving along the ledge, he just let go and fell.  Far too often I was never sure what direction he would jump, which again led to falling and trying again.  It's like somebody just said \"Hey, Uncharted is popular and involves jumping along ledges, let's throw some of that in here.\"  In one case there was an area where I was completely stuck on where to go.  Turns out there was one exact point I had to jump from to land on the next platform, which was off camera.  Wow, just wow.<br /><br />I've been a gamer all my life and never shy away from a challenge, but this game is overtly awful in every possible way.  I actually got angry enough to shout \"I hate this game!\" several times in a manner similar to those Gamefly commercials.  I changed the difficulty all the way down to easy just to make it go by faster, and even then it was torture.  To finish off an early boss, I had to go around the room smashing statues.  Are you kidding me?!  It had nothing to do with anything, and was another random thing I needed a walkthrough to figure out.  It has been a long time since I've played anything this terrible.  Don't even waste the money to rent this garbage, let alone buy it.  I know there are lots of good reviews, but I'm warning you, just don't do it.

This game is a shameless God of War ripoff.  Turning cranks while under attack, annoying flying imps, rotating bridges, button press minigames, very weak enemies that serve as fodder for your hack and slash attacks, orbs that lead to powering up your weapons, etc.  There's even an area where they blatantly had Typhon the Titan from GOW2 blowing wind at you in a cave.  If it was any worse it would border on copyright infringement.  However, I don't care how derivative a game is if it's good, so this is the last mention of those similarities.  BTW, I've never read Dante's Inferno so there will be no observations about how close this is to its source material.<br /><br />Each circle of hell is themed with a different sin for which its inhabitants are being punished.  Unfortunately there are actually very few themed enemies in the game.  Most of your time is spent taking out standard undead soldiers and horned demons.  The stages themselves mostly feature black, nondescript backgrounds and very uninspired music.  The gluttony circle has mouths on everything, but most other levels were very drab.  The graphics are decent but look very unpolished, especially compared to other new PS3 games.  There's simply no attention to detail.  At no time did I ever feel nervous or like I was actually in hell.  The combat itself is really run of the mill, with individual scythe attacks having to be bought with the \"souls\" you collect.  Your projectile attacks stem from your cross, and I used those most of the game because at least they're a bit different from the standard fare.<br /><br />Another issue in this game is the difficulty.  There were early times when it spiked as I was under siege from so many enemies, including some offscreen (how widescreen games in 2010 can have that issue is beyond me).  Most of the game I was able to use my powered up cross-themed projectile attacks to easily dispatch the waves of standard enemies from a distance.  A couple boss fights were frustrating as I tried to figure out what to do, while others were too easy.  I ended up beating the final boss on the first try, and that's always a very bad sign.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that EA, the same company who made the bone-chilling Dead Space, could fail so spectacularly at setting the proper mood for this game.  The plot is razor thin, with Dante simply seeking to save the woman he betrayed.  There are some simplistic moments where his sins are brought up, but nothing that ever feels connected to the gameplay.  I always felt like I was simply dispatching foes to progress to the next bland area.  Cheap platforming deaths abound, with bad camera angles making it unclear where you need to land.  Then there was an area near the end which is icy (yes, ice in hell).  You have to walk slowly across an ice bridge, with sections shaking and breaking loose, dropping you to your death.  It was designed to make people throw their controllers in frustration, and is one more demonstration that people who hate gamers shouldn't be allowed to make games.<br /><br />I never saw a single bug of any kind, and that's the most positive thing I can say about this game.  It only gets three stars because there was technically nothing wrong with it.  Without spoiling anything, they even had the nerve to directly hint at a sequel in the end.

I have finished it once and am already looking forward to my next playthrough to see how different choices affect what happens.  The graphics in this game are outstanding, particularly the photo-realistic character models.  Sony used an orchestra to create the soundtrack for this game, and it is better than typed words can convey.  Think Silence of the Lambs in terms of tension being built up perfectly.  It's also in the back of your mind the whole game that you can get one of the four characters you control killed if you make bad decisions or fail to get them out of danger.  Characters are well developed and likable enough that I cared about keeping them alive, not just to get the best ending.  The game is divided into chapters and sub-chapters, and if you're unhappy with what just happened you can choose to restart from an earlier point.  You can also do so to see how each decision plays out, though I never did because it felt like cheating and largely spoils the game's huge replay value.  Knowing that your actions can and will permanently alter the course of the game and story creates incredible anxiety.<br /><br />This is the first time I have ever enjoyed using the six-axis controls in any game.  At one point I had a guy by the collar and decided to rough him up for information.  By shaking the controller up and down I began shaking the suspect until he talked.  For someone who is not a fan of analog sticks I was amazed by how natural their use was throughout the game.  Each action sequence consists of a button pressing/analog stick moving minigame.  While such minigames have become common and are generally starting to feel overused, every button press in Heavy Rain feels natural within the context of the action onscreen.  When running for your life you choose a direction to push and dodge obstacles accordingly.  You push buttons to punch, kick at or dodge the weapon of your assailant.  You have a window of opportunity to make the correct button presses, which changes based on the difficulty level you choose (you can change the difficulty setting at any time during the game).  Different animations result with each success or failure and accumulate during each minigame until you pass or fail it.  There are also a number of times during the game when you unexpectedly have to react with a single button press.  The only control issue I had was getting used to holding R2 to walk, then using the left stick to change direction.  After countless games where walking is done entirely with the left stick alone I spent the whole game fighting my natural instinct.  They set it up the way it is because cameras are fixed and change routinely as you move through an area.  If you simply hold R2 you'll keep moving straight, but if you fiddle with the left stick you unintentionally change direction every time there's a camera switch.  It's a small price to pay in exchange for fixed cameras that never get stuck on things or end up at bad angles.  Since spotting clues in each room is vital to the game working, Sony made the right choice here.  You can even push L1 to change cameras at almost any time, allowing you to focus on either your own character or the person you're talking to.<br /><br />There have been a lot of video games with much hype around them that failed to deliver, sequels that play it too safe and lack originality, and blatant clones of successful franchises.  Heavy Rain is very original, full of suspense, good writing and voice acting, nice graphics and tremendous sound that set the right atmosphere, and very good controls.

Having done so, and having played the original, I was underwhelmed.  Had I never played the first Bioshock, this sequel would have felt far more impressive.  But as I played the game, I couldn't get past three simple thoughts:<br /><br />1. Unless I used the drill, which is pretty limited by the need for drill fuel, I never felt like a Big Daddy.<br />2. While plasmids have some new upgrades, they're basically the same as before, as are the Splicers.<br />3. Most of my time was spent beating other Big Daddys, adopting their Little Sisters, then escorting them around to gather adam.<br /><br />I opted to adopt and rescue Little Sisters to get the good ending (don't worry, no spoilers here).  Once a Little Sister is done collecting adam it is needlessly hard to pick her back up.  I also routinely had trouble picking up ammo and other items.  The game demands near perfect aim of the camera to acknowledge an object at your feet, which didn't ruin it but was a constant annoyance.<br /><br />Then there's the fact that despite being a Big Daddy, a tough Splicer could bring my health to near empty in three seconds on the normal difficulty setting.  Why are you so much weaker than the other Big Daddys you have to defeat?  For that matter, why do security systems attack you but not any other Big Daddy?  No explanation is ever offered.  A number of major elements in this game simply defied logic and felt glossed over, which was hugely disappointing considering how tight the story was in the original.  Where did the Big Sisters come from?  Why do they show up and attack you AFTER you have saved or harvested roughly every third Little Sister?  Early in the game Dr. Tenenbaum (the woman who acted like a nanny to the sisters in the original) appeals to you to help stop her work from being continued, but then just disappears for the last 90% of the game.  Given that this game's release was delayed, it's stunning how many such holes there are.<br /><br />While overall Bioshock 2 is worth playing, it feels very unfinished.  Given that 2K used the same game engine as the original, that is inexcusable.  It seems like they decided to just shove something out the door to cash in on a popular franchise.  With so many big games out right now, I'd wait on this one until the price comes down.

This game has graphics as great as Tools of Destruction.  It also features the same funny dialogue and top notch voice acting we've come to expect.  Captain Qwark is among my all-time favorite game characters and is hilarious as always here.  Unfortunately, the tools in this game are largely repeats of what we've seen since the first installment.  A pistol and grenades are offered early, but most good weapons are withheld until fairly late in the game.  One powerful weapon, gun turrets, is gone completely, which substantially increases the difficulty.  The best weapon/gadget in video game history, the Groovitron, thankfully came back and never gets tired.  My favorite new weapon is the Rift Inducer 5000, which opens a portal to another dimension, allowing a monster to reach out its tentacles and gobble up any enemy in its vicinity.  I also like the MagNet, an electrified net that automatically locks on its target.  The rest of the weapons are basically rehashes with slight tweaks, and the need to level them all up is a real chore.  Mr. Zurkon is your synthenoid bodyguard, but his one liner taunts get old after a while.  When it came to throwing grenade type weapons, I had lots of trouble aiming; in some cases they went sailing off to the side for no reason at all instead of simply going where I was facing (and where my intended target stood).  Ratchet and Clank are separated for the bulk of the game and alternate missions.  The Clank missions feature awkward fighting and repetitive, unimaginative puzzles.  I couldn't end them fast enough.  Qwark accompanies Ratchet early, but unfortunately it doesn't last long.  The comic relief he provided would have greatly aided in spicing up the repetitive, mindless shooting and shaky platforming.  Far too many times I fell to my death because the game threw me off trajectory during a jump and made me land short of a platform through no fault of my own.  The swingshot likewise failed to deploy at completely random times and led to bug based deaths, including multiple times during one boss fight.  It was terribly frustrating and really took away from the fun factor, especially since I never had these problems in previous titles.  While the characters and story development are as brilliant as ever, this series needs to really look to the future and stop being so redundant.  A game where you primarily play as Captain Qwark would be a comedic gold mine and could offer a chance to fundamentally change the gameplay and breathe fresh air into the series.  This game stands fairly well on its own, but R&C veterans have been here a half dozen times now, and the formula is tired.  Add in the first case of shoddy platforming in the entire series, and I was very disappointed.  Wait for this to hit the bargain bins; there are much better games out there (like Uncharted 2 and Batman: Arkham Asylum).", "ParentASIN": "B00LV8IF8O", "Timestamp": 1261633799000, "ItemName": "Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time - PS3 [Digital Code]", "AuthorName": "", "AverageRating": 4.1, "RatingCount": 18, "Price": null, "Categories": ["Video Games", "Legacy Systems", "PlayStation Systems", "PlayStation 3", "Games"], "Description": "The new space gameplay allows players to engage in battles, explore star systems, and find hidden collectibles.

I also had NHL '02, which I hated.  The demo for this seemed good and I wasn't averse to a simulation style game so I got it.  The graphics are very sharp, the sound is great with lots of ways to customize (I like the ability to adjust the goal horn volume so it sounds like the end of the world when the home team scores).  The commentary even analyzes your gameplay and what is or isn't working.  You can even customize the music with your own tracks.  There are many major improvements like this over the versions of yesteryear.  I got this after the patch came out and have not experienced any issues with bugs.<br /><br />The only thing that destroys the experience is the absolutely broken controls.  I have great patience for learning new and unique control schemes, like UFC Undisputed, Ninja Gaiden and even the dreaded Fight Night analog stick punching.  But there's a difference between awkward and unresponsive.  I get dominated in faceoffs by the CPU no matter how I adjust that option.  Slap shots fail most of the time.  You're supposed to pull back on the right stick, then push it forward to shoot.  What happens is my player lowers his stick, then takes a very weak wrist shot.  Even in practice mode it doesn't work consistently.  Checks are also dicey at best.  I've defended a guy camped near my goal, perfectly timed a poke check to cut off a pass, only to have him receive it anyway and score as if I wasn't even there.  Forget about scoring in this game.  Unless you have the goalie beat with a wide open net, virtually nothing can get past him.  I don't expect to score six goals a game, but one goal on 80 quality shots is ridiculous.  Shot aiming is hard at first, but I got it down and still couldn't score.  Then there's the fighting.  Don't even bother.  Punching is done with the right stick, but half the time it's unresponsive and the other half it's inaccurate.  I try to punch and it does nothing, or try but swing to a different spot than I aimed for and whiff completely, getting knocked out when wide open.  If controllers didn't cost so much I would have thrown mine several times.<br /><br />I have logged around 15 hours of play time, and really wanted to like this game.  I kept telling myself I would eventually get used to the controls, but it never happened.  I spent more of my energy fighting the controls than enjoying the game, and when they lead to giving up a bad goal you have no hope of making up, it's the worst kind of frustration.  Each time I scored I thought \"maybe there's hope\", but then came the flaws and god-like goalie to remind me I would only win if the game \"let me\".  I played on the \"pro\" setting, which is akin to normal, and wins and losses were never in my hands either way.  One-timers, breakaways, dekes, nothing seems to influence the ability to score.  I tried 3-on-0 rushes in practice mode and still seldom scored.  In one game I scored 8 goals despite doing nothing different, then went back to being shut down.  Everything in NHL 10 is immersive except the gameplay.  The love affair EA Sports has with the analog sticks needs to end.  They're inherently imprecise and seldom work for anything but movement and camera adjustment.

It doesn't hurt the gameplay, but comes off as a deliberate attempt to make the game inferior in some way to its X-Box counterpart.  I think the loss of limbs is very exaggerated, and enemies minus an arm or leg actually become more dangerous as they attempt powerful suicide attacks.  This effectively punishes you for doing damage unless you finish them off quickly.  In some cases shooting an enemy in the body with arrows results in him losing an arm.  Huh?  After the amazing dismemberments in Dead Space this seems dated by comparison.<br /><br />I played the first Ninja Gaiden Sigma, and at first was ready to quit after under an hour.  Once I learned to block, evade, and mastered combos and choosing the right weapon for the right enemy, it was still hard but entirely manageable.  Since the combat system is largely unchanged, I had little trouble once I got past the first chapter.  Because the first level up of the dragon sword isn't immediate, I actually found the first chapter the hardest in the game!  How did the dragon sword lose levels between games?  How did Ryu forget techniques?  It's a thing about sequels that always annoys me.  There are about ten different weapons, each with its own strengths and weaknesses relating to range, speed and damage.  This at least provided variety as I easily dispatched waves of enemies.  I beat most of the many bosses on the first try in the normal difficulty setting, and in the entire game died no more than ten times.  I'm shocked at how easy this game was.  Even the final boss went down in one try.  You just learn their pattern, when to block and counter strike, and down they go.  Ninpo is powerful and takes out any enemies around you.  Since weapon upgrades no longer cost yellow orbs, you can hoard orbs and keep health upgrades in constant supply.  You can only carry three of each health up as opposed to six in the previous game, yet it's still far easier.  Even by normal standards this is an overtly easy game, which is why it only gets three stars.  It lasts about fifteen hours, and the other characters add a little variety as well as nice eye candy.  But most of the game just feels like a formality.  Where the first game tested my skills, my nerves and my resolve, this one was a matter of deciding \"how many chapters should I go through today?\".  I had trouble finding one boss' weak point, but otherwise never got stuck on anything.  It makes no sense that the tougher difficulty setting isn't available until you beat it once.  At times I honestly thought I must have inadvertently selected easy mode.  The game is fun and while dated the graphics are still above average.  But while beating NGS was a badge of honor, there was no satisfaction in beating this one at all.<br /><br />While this is a good action game which shouldn't be missed, it's not worth full price.  Wait until it gets marked down, or rent it and beat it in a few marathon sessions.

Besides one break to eat, I didn't stop until my PS3 indicated my controller needed to be recharged!  I'm at best a casual UFC fan, so I can't remark on how true the fighters are represented.  The controls bring a steep learning curve, but make for deep gameplay where button mashing is almost always a bad idea.<br /><br />My only big gripe is the tutorial could have been better.  Not knowing the names of ground positions (open guard, half guard, etc.) made it very hard to understand what I was doing, especially when the camp invitation part of career mode asked me to do specific transitions from one position to another.  I had to go to practice mode and choose each position to see what it looked like.  Now I'm getting to the dominant mount up position and beating the tar out of the CPU.  Submission wins have completely eluded me thus far, even as I pump up my character's submission skills.  Maybe I just need more time with it, but even IGN said submission wins are rare.  It should be noted that the ways to avoid being submitted are \"brute force\" escape with strikes or a technical escape by rotating the right stick.  Some online players are likely button mashing as I initially did, resulting in otherwise avoidable losses.  Learning the controls makes all the difference in this game.<br /><br />Collision detection is great.  I have yet to see anyone's limb pass through their opponent.  Several times the game hiccuped for half a second when both men were attacking, but strangely the more I play the less it seems to happen.  Maybe improving my attributes has something to do with it?<br /><br />Personally I don't miss character development in the career mode.  I didn't buy this game to read generic text.  I just wanted to strategically beat guys up in something other than a traditional fighter or subpar THQ wrestling release.  This fits the bill, and it's different enough from Fight Night that I'll likely still want that too.<br /><br />You don't have to be a UFC fan to enjoy this, just patient enough to spend well over an hour in tutorials and training to learn it.<br /><br />UPDATE: The submissions do work once you know when to use them.  You need to wait until your opponent's stamina is low (the meter that refills when you rest for a few seconds, not total health).  Or you can strike him until he is in a \"rocked\" state and then it's much more likely he can't fight off your attempt.  In certain cases I can get a tapout win in under 90 seconds, but it's not so easy as to ruin the game.  If your opponent has good mat and sub defense skills you won't win that way.

There are no fatality sequences at all.  No severed body parts or anything.  When an enemy is hit by a blade, thrown into spikes, etc., they just groan and bump off of it.  When they die they say some cheesy line (in Japanese with subtitles) fall down and a little round pool of blood forms under them, then they disappear.  Since the entire premise of the game is using traps to kill enemies, a total lack of versatility in their death animations is inexcusable.  Even if there were good fatality sequences the game is so easy it would still be boring.  You practically have to try to get killed, since you can run circles around enemies and rarely get hit.
